#### Abstract
>Aquaponics is a recirculating technology that combines aquaculture with hydroponics. It allows nutrients from ﬁsh waste to feed plants and thus saves water and nutrients. However, there is a mismatch between the nutrients provided by the ﬁsh waste and plant needs. Because of this, some nutrients, notably N, tend to accumulate in the aquaponic water (APW or AP water). The aim of this study was to investigate how APW, which is depleted of P and K but still rich in N, could be further utilized. APW was used in a mesocosm and compared with APW from the same source that had been supplemented with macro-nutrients (complemented AP water or CAPW) and a hydroponic control (HC). Mizuna (M) and rocket salad (R) were used as short-cycle vegetable crops in a NFT system. The results revealed that the low production potential of APW was mainly caused by the lack of P and K. If these were supplemented, the yields were comparable to those in the HC. M yield in CAPW was signiﬁcantly higher than that of HC, probably due to biostimulant effects connected to the organic components in the water as a result of ﬁsh farming. Water type, cultivation density, and intercropping signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the qualitative characteristics of the crop in terms of antioxidant compounds and minerals. Nitrate content in vegetables was lower than European regulation limits. The extended use of APW is viable if the missing nutrients are supplemented; this could be a strategy to increase the efﬁciency of water and nitrogen use, while further reducing environmental impact.

> foliar-tunnel greenhouse at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in 2017. Temperature and light intensity data during the two cultivation cycles are shown in Figure 1. Nine mesocosm systems consisting of one tank each (275 L) and 4 NFT channels for vegetable cultivation (Figure 2) were used for this experiment.

> The water (1.65 m3) from an already existing recirculating AP system (150 pangasius fish with an average weight of 300 g each in a tank of 3 m3 and 7.6 m2 planted area with a complete AP water volume of 7 m3) was diverted to operate the mesocosm AP systems

> here were statistically significant differences between the nutrient solutions, especially in the first phase of the crop cycle. The breakdown threshold was recorded 24 days after seeding (DAS), after which there were no differences in pH values. The pH was consistently the highest in the HC system.

> The production potential of the two vegetables differed, with M delivering consistently higher yields than R (Figure 8). The nutritive solution also strongly influenced crop yield, with higher yields being delivered by the CAPW system; the latter water treatment exerted a significant difference with HC only in the second crop cycle (Figure 8). The APW system was characterized by yields lower than 0.5 kg m−2.

> These products, which are characterized by a very short growth cycle might, therefore, be able to adapt very well to the use of water derived from AP systems. Furthermore, shortly after germination, the young plants can still use some of the nutrients provided in the seed and thus there is a delay before their growth becomes limited.

> The experimental evidence recorded during this experience highlighted the fact that the low production potential of APW is heavily influenced by the substantial absence of P and K.
