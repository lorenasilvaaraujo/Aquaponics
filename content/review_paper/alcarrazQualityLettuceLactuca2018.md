#### Abstract
>Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponic systems where, in general terms, the waste produced by aquatic organisms becomes nutrients through bacterial action for plant growth. Water consumption as well as the environmental impact in this type of system are lower compared to more traditional hydroponic and aquaculture counterparts, due to its dual productive nature and closed condition of the system allowing the reuse of water and fish waste. The present study evaluated the yield, nitrate concentration, microbiological and functional quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in two production systems: aquaponics and hydroponics. At the same time, fresh mass gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were assessed. Lettuces were grown in an aquaponic system using waste water from the fish system, as well as in a hydroponic system with nutrient solution (Hoagland II-modified) both for 21 days. At the end of this period, baby lettuce (8 and 12 cm of length) was harvested. The yield of lettuce grown in aquaponic system was 6.73% higher than that of grown in hydroponic system. Also aquaponically grown lettuce had lower nitrate concentration (1079 mg kg-1 FW) than hydroponically grown lettuce (1229 mg kg-1 FW). Lettuces grown in both systems showed no significant differences in the microbial and functional qualities. Rainbow trout in the aquaponic system increased 13.6 g over 27.1±0.8 g initial fresh weight, obtaining a FCR of 0.74 after the experiment. These results indicate that the aquaponic system used in the present study is a sustainable alternative for the production of high quality lettuce considering its high yield, lower concentration of nitrates and similar microbiological and functional qualities compared to hydroponic systems, while allowing simultaneous fish farming with a good feed conversion ratio (74 g of food was needed to produce 100 g of rainbow trout).



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
> 120 L tank - 40 fish (Rainbow trout) per tank - fish feed twice a day with pellets at 1.44% of their bodymass - starting weight of 13.6g and end weight of 27.1g


```math 
Tank_Water = 120/1000 
Weight_gain = 27.1-13.6
Weight_per_Tank = ( 40*27.1 )/1000

Stocking_density = Weight_per_Tank/Tank_Water
Feed_per_day=  (0.00144*(27.1+13.6)/2*2*40)/1000
Total_feed = 21*Feed_per_day

Acumulated_biomass = 1088 + 1294 +1453 +1614
FCR = Total_feed/Weight_gain
Total_feed/Acumulated_biomass

These	authors	 found	 810	 mg	 kg-1	fw	in	 Spanish	lettuce	cultivated	with	residues	of	pikeperch	(Sander	 lucioperca).	The	nitrate	 concentration	(1087.2±458.1	mg	kg-1	fw)	in	our	hydroponic	lettuce	was	higher	than	the	data	 reported	by	Lastra	et	al.

The	higher	nitrates	concentration	found	in	hydroponic	lettuce	in	the	present	study	could	be	 explained	due	to	the	greater	availability	of	nitrate	in	the	nutrient	solution	at	the	beginning	of	 the	 experiment	 (150	 mg	 L-1).

These authors obtained 2.71 kg m-2 after 21 days from transplant using ‘Roman’ lettuce (20 plants m-2) grown on floating root and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in high density with 8 kg fish m-3. Lennard and Leonard (2006) harvested 4.47±0.12 kg m-2 of ‘Oak’ leaf lettuce (40 plants m-2) in root floating technique using waste of 5 kg of Murray cod m-3. Similarly, Licamele (2009) obtained yields of 4.7 kg m-2 in ‘Rex’ lettuce (32 plants m-2) after 35 days with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) with a density of 5 kg fish m-3. The highest yield described in these studies could be due to Nile tilapia and Murray cod being maintained at 20 to 25°C, the optimal range for these fish and also for nitrifying bacteria and lettuce growth (FAO, 2014).
