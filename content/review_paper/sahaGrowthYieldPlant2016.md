#### Abstract
>Traditional agricultural systems are challenged by globally declining resources resulting from climate change and growing population. Alternative agricultural practices such as aquaponics (includes crop plant and aquatic species) and hydroponics (includes crop plant only) have the potential to generate high yield per unit area using limited land, water, and no soil. A soilless agricultural study was conducted at the Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, USA from August to November, 2015. The growth, yield, quality, and nutrition of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultivar Aroma 2, were compared between aquaponic and hydroponic systems using crayﬁsh (Procambarus spp.) as the aquatic species. Non-circulating ﬂoating raft systems were designed using 95 L polyethylene tanks. Equal amounts of start-up fertilizer dose were applied to both systems. The objective was to understand how the additional nutritional dynamics associated with crayﬁsh inﬂuence the basil crop. Both fresh and dry basil plant weights were collected after harvest, followed by leaf nutrient analysis. Leaf chlorophyll content, water pH, nitrogen and temperature were measured periodically. Aquaponic basil (AqB) showed 14%, 56%, and 65% more height, fresh weight, and dry weight, respectively, compared to hydroponic basil (HyB). It is logical to assume that crayﬁsh waste (excreta and unconsumed feed) has supplied the additional nutrients to AqB, resulting in greater growth and yield. The chlorophyll content (plant quality) or leaf nutrients, however, did not differ between AqB and HyB. Further research is needed to investigate aquaponic crayﬁsh yield, overall nutritional dynamics, cost-beneﬁt ratio, and other plant characteristics under soilless systems.



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
>Controlled environment (greenhouse), added algae to fish feed. Added an initial fertilizer dose to both hydroponic and aquaponic.  Pelletized commercial food Spirulina flakes and algal wafers were applied as crayfish feed, which has 55% and 30% of crude protein, respectively. (3 g of algal wafers and 1.5 g of Spirulina). 4 tanks of 83 L = 0.332 m³ with four mature crayfish in each (16 crayfish). According to [FAOFisheriesProcambarus](review_paper/FAOFisheriesProcambarus.md) ,the mean weight for Procambarus clarkii crayfish is between 35 to 56 g . For feed conversion rate we can assume that 4.5g of feed was given per tank weekly for 15 weeks to grow the crayfish from 35 to 56 g = 0.8 which is comparable to the FCR present in [wanEffectsPelletedExtruded2022](review_paper/wanEffectsPelletedExtruded2022.md)

| Experiment | Hydroponics + Nutrient | Aquaponics + Nutrient | Unit of measure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Basil | 96.6 | 150.2 | Plant fresh weight (g) |



```math 
 Experiment = 150.2/96.6 
Feed_protein = (1.5*55+3*30)/4.5

water_content = 4*83/1000
Crayfish_start_weight= 35
Crayfish_finish_weight= 56
Crayfish_average_weight = (Crayfish_finish_weight + Crayfish_start_weight)/2

Stocking_density = (Crayfish_average_weight*16/1000)/water_content

weight_gain = Crayfish_finish_weight - Crayfish_start_weight
FCR = ((1.5+3)*15)/(weight_gain*4)
```

> Plant growth and yield were higher in aquaponic basil (AqB) than in hydroponic basil (HyB). The basil mean plant height at harvest was 14% higher in AqB (89.9 cm ± 4.5) than in Hyb. (78.7 cm ± 3.9)
