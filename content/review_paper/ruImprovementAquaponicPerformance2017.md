> Micro- and macro-nutrients were added to the treatment aquaponics weekly to keep their concentrations as similar as one half Hoagland micro-element solution (Rakocy et al. 2003), while there was no micro- and macro-nutrient addition in the control. 

> [!quote|yellow]+ Highlight ([page. 16330](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RINUJNZV?page=16330&annotation=7VSLYRPA))
> During the entire study period, no fish and plant died or got illness, indicating that micro- and macro-nutrient treatment did not have unfavorable effect on mortality and morbidity for fish and plants.

>Fish production and pak choi yield were improved by 52.9 and 83.6%, respectively, after the addition of micro- and macro-nutrients, which resulted in higher NUE of treatment aquaponics
