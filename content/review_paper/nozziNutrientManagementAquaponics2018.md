#### Abstract
>Nutrients that are contained in aquaculture efﬂuent may not supply sufﬁcient levels of nutrients for proper plant development and growth in hydroponics; therefore, they need to be supplemented. To determine the required level of supplementation, three identical aquaponic systems (A, B, and C) and one hydroponic system (D) were stocked with lettuce, mint, and mushroom herbs. The aquaponic systems were stocked with Nile tilapia. System A only received nutrients derived from ﬁsh feed; system B received nutrients from ﬁsh feed as well as weekly supplements of micronutrients and Fe; system C received the same nutrients as B, with weekly supplements of the macronutrients, P and K; in system D, a hydroponic inorganic solution containing N, Ca, and the same nutrients as system C was added weekly. Lettuce achieved the highest yields in system C, mint in system B, and mushroom herb in systems A and B. The present study demonstrated that the nutritional requirements of the mint and mushroom herb make them suitable for aquaponic farming because they require low levels of supplement addition, and hence little management effort, resulting in minimal cost increases. While the addition of supplements accelerated the lettuce growth (Systems B, C), and even surpassed the growth in hydroponic (System C vs. D), the nutritional quality (polyphenols, nitrate content) was better without supplementation.

Each hydroponic unit comprised of three table sections (1.2 m × 2 m each) for plant production, covering a total surface of 7.2 m2 for each AP. Each table section was filled with 25 mm water.  The conventional hydroponic system (D) consisted of a HP unit as described above and two sumps with a total volume of approximately 630 L.

> Each fish tank was stocked with 50 Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, see Table 2), each weighing approximately 220 g (see Table 2). The fish were fed approximately 2% of their body weight per day with Tilapia Vegi 4.5 mm, a floating, extruded feed (Hokovit Hofmann Nutrition AG, Bützberg, Switzerland). (main ingredients: soybean meal, wheat, corn gluten meal, linseed oil; composition in g/kg: crude protein 375, crude lipid 72, crude fiber 23, ash 86)). Feeding was distributed over six automated feeding times (7:00, 8:00, 10:00, 12:00, 15:00, 17:00), and the total amount of feed added was recorded. The fish were monitored every day to evaluate feeding and appetite, and to check for possible deaths. Three crops were tested: lettuce (Lactuca sativa YACHT, Salanova®), the crop of most economic interest, and two herbs: a mint (Mentha piperita CHOCOLATE) and mushroom herb (Rungia klossii). Each hydroponic unit hosted 36 lettuces, 72 mints, and 72 mushroom herbs. The plants were exposed to a natural photoperiod.

> this study highlights that higher management effort and costs do not always result in optimal plant growth; the management effort is highly dependent on the plant species that are cultivated. More specifically, the moderate nutritional requirements of mint and mushroom herb make them suitable for farming in AP with little management effort and costs.
