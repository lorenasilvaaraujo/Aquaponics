#### Abstract
>Aquaponics is the land-based production of fish in tanks combined with the recirculation of the water from the fish tanks through hydroponic systems to produce high value horticultural crops. The waste products from the fish are converted by a bio-filter into soluble nutrients, which are absorbed by the plants, and allow “clean” water to be returned back to the fish. Thus, it produces valuable fish protein with a minimal pollution of fresh water resources, while at the same time producing horticultural (usually vegetable) crops. The production of fertilizers is becoming increasingly expensive due to high prices on fossil fuels, and this may have long term implications for nutrient use in agriculture in the future. Aquaponics uses waste products derived from animals and plants which are fed to the fish, and thus converted into valuable animal protein and fresh vegetables. With the world’s fresh water resources limited, aquaponics would appear to have considerable potential for arid and similar climates. Disease and pest problems are minimized because of the development of an ecological balance. Productivity is commonly as good (or better) than with conventional hydroponic systems.

> It appears that the levels of nutrients within the aquaponic system are considerably lower than those found (and used) in conventional hydroponics, and yet productivity would appear to be at least as high as with conventional systems.

> In hydroponic systems the spread of root diseases can be extremely rapid, but this does not appear to happen in aquaponic systems, and it would appear that some form of biological balance develops in the solution, in a similar manner to the biological balance which develops in a deep sand filter in conventional hydroponics.

> The standard fish used world-wide in aquaponics is tilapia, but in Australia barramundi and Murray cod have been used successfully, while in New Zealand the grass carp has been used.

> Neither is perfect, but each shows that aquaponics can be considered to be at least as productive as conventional hydroponics for leafy vegetables. For the fruit vegetables (such as tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet peppers) the situation is not so clear cut.
