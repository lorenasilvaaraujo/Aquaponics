#### Abstract
>Integrating hydroponic and aquaculture systems (aquaponics) requires balanced pH for plants, ﬁsh, and nitrifying bacteria. Nitriﬁcation prevents accumulation of ﬁsh waste ammonia by converting it to NO3–-N. The difference in optimum pH for hydroponic cucumber (Cucumis sativa) (5.5 to 6.0) and nitriﬁcation (7.5 to 9.0) requires reconciliation to improve systems integration and sustainability. The purpose of this investigation was to: 1) determine the ammonia bioﬁltration rate of a perlite trickling bioﬁlter/root growth medium in an aquaponic system, 2) predict the relative contribution of nitriﬁers and plants to ammonia bioﬁltration, and 3) establish the reconciling pH for ammonia bioﬁltration and cucumber yield in recirculating aquaponics. The bioﬁltration rate of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal was 19, 31, and 80 gÁm–3Ád–1 for aquaponic systems [cucumber, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp. + Nitrobacter sp.)] with operating pH at 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively. With the existing aquaponic design (four plants/20 L perlite bioﬁlter/100 L tank water), the aquaponic bioﬁlter (with plants and nitriﬁers) was three times more effective at removing TAN compared with plant uptake alone at pH 6.0. Most probable number of Nitrosomonas sp. bacteria cells sampled from bioﬁlter cores indicated that the aquaculture control (pH 7.0) had a signiﬁcantly higher (0.01% level) bacteria cell number compared with treatments containing plants in the bioﬁlter (pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0). However, the highest TAN removal was with aquaponic production at pH 8.0. Thus, operating pH was more important than nitrifying bacteria population in determining the rate of ammonia bioﬁltration. Early marketable cucumber fruit yield decreased linearly from 1.5 to 0.7 kg/plant as pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0, but total marketable yield was not different. The reconciling pH for this system was pH 8.0, except during production for early-season cucumber market windows in which pH 7.0 would be recommended.



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
> 58 days of experiment in a pad and fan greenhouse with polyethylene cover at the University of Florida from 6 July to 12 October 2006.
> 15 fish per tank with a mean of 32.4 g/fish/tank (size range of 8 to 122g). Each tank was filled with 100L of well water.
> Fish feed contained 41% protein and was fed at a rate of 3 g/tank/d.
> Final total fish biomass was 316 g for pH6 aquaponic treatment.

| Experiment | Hydroponic | Aquaponic | Unit of Measure |

| ph6 | 3.63 | 3.64 | kg/plant |
| ph7 | N/A | 4.12 | kg/plant |
| ph8 | N/A | 3.54 | kg/plant |


```math 
 ph6 = 3.64/3.63 

 Fish_weight=15*32.4/1000
 Stocking_density = Fish_weight/(100/1000)

Final_n_fish=316/79
Fish_weight_Gain= Final_n_fish*(79-37)/1000

> These results imply that fish were healthier, under less environmental stress, and more likely to survive as pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0. 

> [!quote|orange]+ Highlight ([page. 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BNPF4NP3?page=6&annotation=HRAGLNXF))
> Results indicate that given the importance of pH in biofilter activity and no difference in total cucumber yields in a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0, then recirculating aquaponic systems using cucumber and tilapia with high densities of fish should be managed with pH closer to those favoring nitrification (7.5 to 8.0) to efficiently convert waste ammonia to nitrate nitrogen.
