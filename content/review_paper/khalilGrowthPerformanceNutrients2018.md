#### Abstract
>Aquaponics is an integrated production of fish and hydroponic crops with recirculation of the nutrient solution in which fish wastes are used as plant fertilizers. Development towards bioeconomical based cultivation system using industrial symbioses makes application of aquaponics systems in areas with surpluses or excess heat of great interest. Within the frame of these surpluses a significant amount of energy leaves the processes as low-grade heat through flue gas stacks and cooling water. However, little knowledge is available about the effect of low water temperature on the growth and microbial parameters in an aquaponics system. Investigations in the current study were thus carried out to study the effect of water temperature of 11°C compared with 21°C on plant growth, nutrient and microbial dynamic in aquaponic systems. Two cultivation systems (treatments) were used, an aquaponic system consisted of a fish tank, a biofilter and a plant unit, and a hydroponic system (control) consisted of a water tank and a plant unit. Basil and trout were used as model organisms. The experiment was run for a period of eight weeks and repeated over time. The results indicated good fish growth and better plant growth in aquaponics systems compared with hydroponic systems at both water temperatures. The growth, as indicated by plant biomass, leaf length and width as well as nitrate content in the leaves, was better at water temperature of 21°C compared with 11°C. Low water temperature of 11°C indicated a negative effect on biofiltration, microbial dynamics and disease incidence in the system. Negative correlation between the total nitrogen removal rate and low water temperature was also indicated.



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
>Climate chamber, small experiment but temperature and PAR controlled.
>Samples of trout (8 fish per tank - 50 L) were obtained from a local trout producer. The fish were hand-fed once a day during the experiment with a commercial feed at a rate of 1% of fish body weight.

> Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum ‘Genovese’) was used as a model crop and trout (Salmo trutta) was used as a model fish.

> The experiment was carried out in a climate chamber under controlled conditions for a period of eight weeks, and was repeated over time. In total two experiments were performed. Each experiment consisted of two treatments, an aquaponics system and a hydroponics (control) system. Three replicates were included in each treatment. The treatments were investigated at two different water temperatures, 11°C and 21°C. Each replicate in the aquaponics treatment consisted of one fish tank with a volume of 50 L and a cultivation gutter for the plant unit.
