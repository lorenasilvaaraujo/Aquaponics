#### Abstract
>Aquaponics for intensive crop production is a highly complex system in which three different biological systems (ﬁsh, plants, and nitrifying bacteria) with different requirements must be merged. Finding the right combination is a serious challenge and the dependencies avoid a high productivity until now. Therefore, a unique and innovative double recirculating aquaponic system (DRAPS) was developed as a prerequisite for a high productivity comparable to professional stand-alone ﬁsh/plant facilities. It consists of two independent recirculating units – a recirculating aquaculture unit for ﬁsh production and a closed hydroponic cycle for plant production – which were connected unidirectional. This allows the use of ﬁsh waste water as nutrient supply for plants in hydroponics and its optimization for plant growth by fertilizer supply without negative effects on ﬁsh rearing. Furthermore it allows a sustainable food production.



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
> Venlo-type greenhouse with weekly measures and adjustments. Shows there is less blossom-end rot in aquaponics then hydroponics. Stocking density of 20.7 kg/m³. From 23.01.2015 until 08.01.2016. Harvest of 197 days. The amount of 31.64 kg tomato fruit per m2 was harvested in hydroponics, while in aquaponics was 29.38 kg m−2, being not significant different. Total fish net production volume of 7.2 m3. Feeding rate was between 0.7% and 2.4%

> During the harvest period of 197 days, a total amount of 31.64 kg tomato fruit per m2 was harvested in hydroponics, while in aquaponics was 29.38 kg m−2, being not significant different. The rate of marketable fruit on total yield was nearly the same in both treatments (hydroponics = 99.1%, aquaponics = 99.5%). However, the production under aquaponic conditions resulted in a significant smaller rate (−0.37%) of fruit affected by [[blossom end rot (BER)]] compared to those ripened in hydroponics.

> The plants grown under aquaponic conditions formed a significant smaller leaf area per plant (1.15 m2) than those grown in hydroponics (1.36 m2) (Table 2). However, the smaller leaf area in aquaponics was not accompanied by a lower number of leaves per plant.

> rom 23.01.2015 (initial fish stocking) until the last day of tomato harvest (27.10.2015) the total fresh water consumption of the RAS amounted to be 160.4 m3. The aquaponic treatment, with a total of 48 plants, consumed 13.6 m3, i.e. 8.5% of the available fish waste water, from the day of planting (05.02.2015) until 27.10.2015. However, 14.2 m3 fresh water were consumed by the hydroponic treatment during the plant growth period.
