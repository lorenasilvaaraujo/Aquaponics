#### Abstract
>Spinach (Spinacia oleracea cv. Carmel) was grown in a conventional glass greenhouse under three different nutrient solution treatments. Lighting and temperature conditions were identical. Six growing systems were used to provide a duplicate trough system for each of these three treatments. Six trials were harvested from each system over a two month time period. Two treatments received hydroponic nutrient inputs, with one treatment at pH 7.0 (referred to as H7) and the other at pH 5.8 (H5), and the third treatment was aquaponic (A7), receiving all of its nutrients from a single ﬁsh tank with koi (Cyprinus carpio) except for chelated iron. System pH was regulated by adding K2CO3 to aquaponic systems and KOH to hydroponic systems. Comparisons made between treatments were total yield, leaf surface area, tissue elemental content, and dry weight to fresh weight ratio. Dry weight biomass yield values were not different in pairwise comparisons between treatments (A7 vs. H5: p = 0.59 fresh weight, p = 0.42 dry weight). Similarly, surface area results were not different between treatments. The important comparison was that A7 achieved the same growth as H5, the conventional pH with a complete inorganic nutrient solution, despite unbalanced and less than “ideal” nutrient concentrations in the A7 condition.



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
>The fish tank was 1000 L and had been in continuous operation for two years.  
>Fish were fed a synthetic manufactured Koi feed (Blackwater Creek’s Max Growth Koi Food “Premium Koi and Goldfish Food”). The fish were hand fed twice daily to apparent satiation on weekdays (total of 90 g), and 60 g on weekends (once daily), which was approximately 1.5% body weight per day on weekdays. The koi were approximately 200–400 g in size (tank density of ~7 kg/m3) and their body condition factor was considered typical and indicative of appropriate feeding levels.

Surprisingly, zinc (Zn) was significantly higher in aquaponic tissue.
