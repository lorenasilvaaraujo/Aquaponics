#### Abstract
>The goal of this study was to prove that aquaponic systems can produce lettuce of equal growth and quality compared to hydroponic lettuce production and to determine the stocking density of fish required for plant growth. Aquaponics is the integration of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponic plant production. The project had four objectives. The first objective was to determine the biomass of fish required for plant growth to develop a fish to plant density ratio. The second objective was to compare lettuce grown with aquaponic water and a hydroponic solution under the same environmental conditions. The third objective was to compare the quality of lettuce grown with aquaponics water plus nutrient supplementation with a hydroponic solution. The fourth objective was to determine the nitrogen dynamics in the aquaponic system and to compare the nutrient composition of lettuce grown with aquaponics water with nutrient supplementation and hydroponic solution. It was determined that under the specified environmental conditions 5 kg m-3 of Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) fed 2% of their body weight daily yields on average 4.7 kg m-2 of lettuce (L. sativa cv. Rex) in 35 days. There was no significant difference (p≤0.05) in biomass or chlorophyll concentration index in lettuce (L. sativa cv. Rex) grown with aquaponics water and nutrient supplements versus a hydroponic solution. The aquaponics solution generated equal biomass and chlorophyll concentration indexes compared to the hydroponic solution. Aquaponics water plus supplementation can yield L. sativa cv. Rex with equal biomass accumulation and chlorophyll concentration indexes compared to hydroponics lettuce. Nutrients added to the aquaponics system consisted of iron, manganese, and zinc. These nutrient concentrations became depleted in the aquaponics water over time and were not replenished via the fish feed. Dolomite was added to the aquaponics system every two weeks to increase the buffering capacity of the water and maintain optimal pH levels. Aquaponics lettuce had similar nutrient composition to hydroponic lettuce. One head of L. sativa cv. Rex (176.75 ± 31.03) will assimilate approximately 5.96 grams of nitrogen (3.38% per dry gram lettuce). One kilogram of fish will yield 6.4 lettuce heads (1,128 grams) and fixate 38.13 grams of nitrogen.



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
>Difference between trials in terms of timing and amount of nutrients added. First trial there is no number documented, but it says it is statically the same (in the graph it shows around 210 for both Aquaponics and Hydroponics. 
>
>2nd trial The aquaponic lettuce had a greater mean head wet weight (182.79 ± 26.90 grams) and mean head dry weight (6.29 ± 0.74 grams at harvest).
>
>3rd trial Mean wet weight for aquaponics lettuce (176.75 ± 31.04 grams) was equal to or greater than lettuce grown with hydroponic solution (148.55 ± 21.71 grams).
> 
>The mean [[FCR]] for the fish was 2.56 ± 0.64 and mean fish survival was 82.94% ± 0.07. Fish stocking densities of 110 and 114 fish per growout tank yielded a lower FCR (3.03 and 2.82 respectively) than tanks stocked with 80 fish (1.83). 110 fish were stocked. There are 4 growout tanks of 1300L each. 1 and 2 tank had 30 kg of fish, 3 had 35 kg and 4 had 15 kg
