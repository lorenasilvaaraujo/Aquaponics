> Not peer reviewed (doesn't even have an abstract), very simple and not as scientific. Lacks many information and bases bibliography on other not peer-reviewed articles.

#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
>Six koi ranging from 20-50 cm in size were added to the system. Does not say anything else about the fish or feed. Even though the leaf number is smaller in aquaponics for young plants, the leaf density is statistically the same.

|  | Hydroponics | Aquaponics | Unit of measure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4 leaves Young | 28.67 | 40.67 | Leaf number |
| 4 leaves Old | 52.58 | 54.42 | Leaf number |
| 4 leaves Young | 0.49 | 0.49 | Leaf density |
| 4 leaves Old | 0.52 | 0.49 | Leaf density |


```math 
 Young = 1-(40.67/28.67)
 Old = 1-(54.42/52.58)
```

> he objectives of this project are to compare: (1) water nutrient profiles in aquaponic and hydroponic systems over time, (2) basil (Ocimum basilicum var. Eleonora) harvest yields in both aquaponic and hydroponic systems to determine if the added complexity of an aquaponic system is justified and (3) essential oil composition of basil in both systems.

> By two weeks, basil plants in the aquaponics system had more aphids and aphid damage compared to the hydroponics system

> Here, we show that (1) aquaponics provided a more constant supply of nutrients to plants when compared to hydroponics, (2) there were significant differences in leaf number and plant height, but these differences depended on age of the plants when introduced into the system, and (3) the essential oil composition is different in basil grown in hydroponic and aquaponic systems.

> o initiate the experiment, basil plants (Ocimum basilicum var. Eleonora) were divided into four treatments (n = 12 for each treatment) based on system type (hydroponics or aquaponics, determined by random selection) and age when added to its respective system: 4-week old “young” plants or 6-week old “old” plants.

> Each plant was measured for stem length and number of leaves after 2 and 4-weeks of growth. After measurements were taken at the 4-week interval, 2 leaves were taken from each “old” plant for essential oil analysis.

> However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that academic research of this idea was incorporated into contemporary food production systems (Watten and Busch 1984).

> Though there have been observations that aquaponic systems are not more productive than hydroponics until they have been established (~6 months), there have yet to be any empirical studies exploring this (Wilson 2005).

> both systems showed changes over time (Figure 4). In the hydroponic system, cation concentrations changed minimally over time, but anions had large increases in nitrate, phosphate and sulfate over the study period. The aquaponics system showed some changes in the concentrations of specific cations over the study period.
