#### Opinion
> [!tip] Opinion
>Good article, even though it is old. Explains methods and results adequately. It would have been better if the tomato plants were compared to hydroponics under the same conditions. It uses other authors and conditions to compare aquaponics to hydroponics.

#### Abstract
>An artificial ecosystem was developed with the aim of associating fish production with a vegetable crop purifying the fish water, in a closed system. The nitrogenous compounds excreted in dissolved form by the fish, and transformed by the bacteria, provide nitrogen for the plants. Previous studies have focused on the system's design and the management of the plant compartment in order to achieve a state of equilibrium.



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
> 68 days for winter experiment with lettuce. Cannot consider tomato experiment which was longer because the control (hydroponics) was not done on site, rather compared versus other literature. There were some mortalities during experiments which might have affected the overall balance. Feed Conversion rate of 1.9 (adult fish in autumn). Stocking density for winter can be calculated (all adult fish) with a total weight of 7.4 kg and a volume of the system in 2.25 m³ =3.3 kg/m³ (author says that size of fish compartment was much bigger than plant compartment)

| Cultivars | Aquaponics | % of control (Hydroponics) |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Judy | 325 | 100 | Fresh weight (g) per head |
| Musette | 199 | 73 | Fresh weight (g) per head |
| Ardente | 167 | 73 | Fresh weight (g) per head |
| GL 659 | 171 | 112 | Fresh weight (g) per head |
| Malika | 162 | 79 | Fresh weight (g) per head |
| Salinas | 101 | 60 | Fresh weight (g) per head |
| Parris Island | 166 | 82 | Fresh weight (g) per head |
| Red Head | 146 | 66 | Fresh weight (g) per head |


```math 
 Stocking_Density = 7.4/2.25
 Average_perc = (100+73+73+112+79+60+82+66)/8

> Fruit yield of the tomato crop was 0.5 kg per plant in the one-cluster plants and 5 kg per plant in the ten-cluster plants. This average yield of 0.5 kg per plant per cluster represents 70 to 85 % of the cluster yield of the Fedine variety in intensive field culture (Odet, 1987; Odet and Jay, 1987). Tomato production in the ecosystem was about 60-75 % of the production of Dutch cultivars in a greenhouse, for an equivalent period (Letard and Le QuiUec, 1990; Boidin et al., 1993).

> The present paper deals with two contrasted periods of functioning: ( 1) a spring-summer period (February-July 1989) with fish production from fingerlings and vegetable production by staggered tomato crops; (2) a winter period (December-February 1990) set aside for a trial of plant diversification with a lettuce crop and adult fish.
