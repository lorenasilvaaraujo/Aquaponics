#### Abstract
>A recent study related to aquaponics has shown that hydroponic lettuce grown in aquaculture derived supplemented water grew significantly better than lettuce grown in a conventional hydroponic system. The principal objective of this study was to verify this finding in a larger setup. Even though the aquaculture water that was added to the aquaculture-based hydroponic system contained relatively high amounts of sodium, we were still able to observe an enhanced growth performance of the lettuce in that system compared to the lettuce grown in the conventional hydroponic nutrient solution. The lettuce final fresh weight was 7.9%, and its final dry weight even 33.2% higher than the one of the hydroponic control.

> The climate was monitored (temperature, relative humidity (RH), irradiation). Water loss due to evapotranspiration and leakage was replaced continuously in the basin, while the electrical conductivity (EC) and acidity (pH) were measured daily, and kept constant on 1800 μScm−2 and pH 5.0–6.0 respectively. Every 2 weeks, 40 L RAS water was added to the hydroponic sump.

> The EC was maintained constant throughout the experiment. Average day temperatures were 17.7 °C, while average outside irradiation was 1584.66 J cm−2 day−1 and light transmission index of the foil greenhouse was 57.7%.

> At harvest, the lettuce from the RAS water system was further developed than the lettuce that was grown in pure hydroponic water. This was indicated by the fact that the RAS-system lettuce was in the heading stage at harvest,
