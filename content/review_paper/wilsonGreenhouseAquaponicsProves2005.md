#### Opinion
> [!tip] Opinion
> Zero scientific method applied, very rudimentary. Not a paper. Based on Rakocy UVI model (who became a consultant) but does not say which fish. Assuming Tilapia as is the UVI model.
>Says two years but doesn't specify dates.



#### Self Notes

> [!info] Experiment data
>

| Trial |Hydroponics  |Aquaponics  |Unit of measure  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  Tomato 2003| 50 |32  |kg/m³  |
| Cucumber 2003 | 54 | 46 | kg/m³ |
| Tomato 2004 | 44 |  60| kg/m³ |
| Cucumber 2004 | 52 | 78 | kg/m³ |


```math 
 Tomato2003 = 1-(32/50) 
 Cucumber2003 = 1-(46/54)

Tomato2004 = 60/40 
Cucumber2004 = 78/52
```

##### ⭐ Overall Notes

> [!quote|yellow]+ Highlight ([page. 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E3WTDYWP?page=2&annotation=VXURY3QC))
> More than 60 different food crops and varieties have been tested in the Alberta greenhouse and 24 were chosen for trials on production levels. Five were greenhouse vegetables and 19 were herbs.

> when the aquaponic system is fully operational after six months, it leaps ahead of inorganic hydroponics. 

> [!quote|orange]+ Highlight ([page. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E3WTDYWP?page=3&annotation=BVQMFRGN))
> The same yields of vegetables as in hydroponics are achievable using aquaponics technology. 

> [!quote|orange]+ Highlight ([page. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E3WTDYWP?page=3&annotation=SYQ8AHXY))
> The aquaponics system has an intrinsic capacity of self-regulation and balancing nutrients in the solution.
