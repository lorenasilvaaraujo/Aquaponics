#### Abstract
>In the study of aquaponics, questions have risen concerning the role of microbiota upon plant growth. This experiment compared unaltered aquaponic nutrient solution at pH 7.0 (treatment A7) with sterilized aquaponic nutrient solution at pH 7.0 (treatment SA7) to quantify effects that live microorganisms had on the growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Baseline comparisons were made to conventional hydroponic conditions using inorganic nutrients at pH 5.8 (treatment H5) or pH 7.0 (treatment H7), which showed a 51% reduction in lettuce fresh weight (FW) growth, indicating a strong negative effect of the higher pH nutrient solution; a similar large difference (38%) occurred for dry weight (DW) comparisons between these two treatments. No difference occurred between the sterilized aquaponic treatment (SA7) and H5 in FW or DW. H5 produced more FW and DW than the non-sterile aquaponic treatment (A7). Responses were not different in FW and DW between the two aquaponic conditions. Reduced FW and DW of A7 compared to H5 may be related to the 50 times higher microbial community living in the A7 treatment water than in H5 at the beginning of each trial. Given that the sterile aquaponic solution SA7 and the H5 hydroponic condition were not different in performance, we concluded that the beneﬁcial effects of the microbial community in the ﬁsh recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) occurred before the water was sterilized. An interesting implication of our ﬁndings is that an RAS can be decoupled from the hydroponic growing system, since its beneﬁts are not dependent upon continuous recirculation between the plant and ﬁsh system and its living biotic community.

> All food was used within six months of the mill date to ensure nutritional quality; details of the fish system and feeding protocols are given in our earlier papers [7,9] 

> [!quote|green]+ Highlight ([page. 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SZ4P2KTM?page=9&annotation=8Q67KTV2))
> Ling and Chen [14] showed that increased organic loading on autotrophic biological filters reduced nitrification rates exponentially as the C/N ratio increased from 0 to 2, which would support our observation that increased bacterial loading on the roots compromised plant growth rates. 

> [!quote|green]+ Highlight ([page. 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SZ4P2KTM?page=9&annotation=REF6PRBS))
> In similar research by our group [7], we conducted extensive trials growing lettuce to 150 g under treatment conditions represented by three of the same conditions as those used in the research reported herein (H5, H7, and A7), but with no sterilized treatment of A7.

> Frequent replacement of nutrient solution, in addition to the factors mentioned in the treatments in Section 2.2, were intended to maintain pH and nutrient availability at near target values. 

> [!quote|orange]+ Highlight ([page. 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SZ4P2KTM?page=9&annotation=SJQ2MQDM))
> The data clearly indicated that there was a net positive effect gained from sterilizing the aquaponic water prior to transferring to the plants which may have contributed some benefits. 

> [!quote|orange]+ Highlight ([page. 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SZ4P2KTM?page=9&annotation=Q6ZDVVPT))
> It is possible that the much larger bacterial community in A7 could have compromised plant nutrient availability by consuming nutrients or by increasing the energetic cost to import nutrients across the root interface. 

> [!quote|orange]+ Highlight ([page. 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SZ4P2KTM?page=9&annotation=TNFJ37UM))
> However, the research presented here refutes that concept, indicating that other factors affected the nutrient availability in hydroponic lettuce culture than the live biotic community present in the root zone. 

> [!quote|orange]+ Highlight ([page. 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SZ4P2KTM?page=9&annotation=XN47IRLI))
> Our research does indicate that while microbiota in the root zone supplied directly from the RAS are unimportant to the growth of the plant, microbial communities in the biofilter cause currently unknown biochemical processes on the RAS water that likely result in the RAS water providing increased growth to the plants. 

> [!quote|orange]+ Highlight ([page. 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SZ4P2KTM?page=9&annotation=FLAS3GBS))
> Natural chelators, cofactors, enzymes, hormones, differing forms of nutrients, mycorrhizal communities, and more are possibilities for further research into possible causal agents.

> Lettuce plants grown in sterilized aquaponic water (SA7) produced similar FW and DW to those in ideal hydroponic conditions at pH 5.8 (H5), while plants in non-sterile aquaponic water (A7) had reduced FW and DW. This strongly suggests that the positive contribution of the living microbes in the RAS had already occurred prior to the RAS water being removed and then sterilized for the SA7 treatment
