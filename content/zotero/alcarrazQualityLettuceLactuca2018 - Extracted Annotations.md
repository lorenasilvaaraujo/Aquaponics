The recommendation indicates that the concentration of NO3 must be less than 150 mg L-1 because more is toxic for fish ([Alcarraz et al 2018:32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=2))

High concentrations of nitrate in leafy vegetables can be also dangerous to the health of consumers. ([Alcarraz et al 2018:32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=2))

The yield of lettuce grown in the aquaponic system was similar to that of reported by Pantanella et al. (2012). These authors obtained 2.71 kg m-2 after 21 days from transplant using 'Roman' lettuce (20 plants m-2) grown on floating root and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in high density with 8 kg fish m-3. Lennard and Leonard (2006) harvested 4.47±0.12 kg m-2 of 'Oak' leaf lettuce (40 plants m-2) in root floating technique using waste of 5 kg of Murray cod m-3. Similarly, Licamele (2009) obtained yields of 4.7 kg m-2 in 'Rex' lettuce (32 plants m-2) after 35 days with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) with a density of 5 kg fish m-3. The highest yield described in these studies could be due to Nile tilapia and Murray cod being maintained at 20 to 25°C, the optimal range for these fish and also for nitrifying bacteria and lettuce growth (FAO, 2014). ([Alcarraz et al 2018:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=3))

The nitrate concentration in lettuce cultivated in our aquaponics system was greater than the results obtained by Blidariu et al. (2013). These authors found 810 mg kg-1 fw in Spanish lettuce cultivated with residues of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca). The nitrate concentration (1087.2±458.1 mg kg-1 fw) in our hydroponic lettuce was higher than the data reported by Lastra et al. (2009) for the cultivars 'Grand Rapids', 'Breeze', 'Divine' and 'Prima'. The higher nitrates concentration found in hydroponic lettuce in the present study could be explained due to the greater availability of nitrate in the nutrient solution at the beginning of the experiment (150 mg L-1). While for the lettuce in the aquaponic system the average concentration of nitrate was 14.9 mg L-1. ([Alcarraz et al 2018:34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=4))

n this study, lettuces were harvested at 12 h in both systems. ([Alcarraz et al 2018:34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=4))

mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts (MAB) in leaves were similar to those reported by Sirsat and Neal (2013) with 3.2 log CFU g-1 for 'Romaine' lettuce cultivated in aquaponics under a greenhouse. Scuderi et al. (2011) reported counts of 6.0 log CFU g-1 for lettuce grown in a hydroponic floating root system. Enterobacteriaceae count was less than 2.3 log CFU g-1 reported by Scuderi et al. (2011) in a similar study. The psychrophilic bacteria count was lower than the value reported by Orellana (2011), who found 4.9 log CFU g-1 in rocket leaves grown in hydroponic system. According to Selma et al. (2012), psychrophilic bacteria can quickly decrease the quality of refrigerated products like vegetables. Low microbial counts in leaves were found in all harvest times according to the Chilean legislation, probably due to drinking water was used in the experiments (Hollyer et al., 2009; MINSAL, 2014).
