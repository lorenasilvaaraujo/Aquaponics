  abstract = {Background and Objective: Aquaponic is a type of recirculating aquaculture system where plant and fish provide suitable media for the development of each. The lipid classes, fatty acids profile and ovary structure of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus reared in this type of system aquaponic parents (AP) and also their first generation aquaponic progeny (AG) allowed to develop in this system till ripening and were evaluated and compared with control parent (CP) and control progeny (CG) reared in normal aquaria. Methodology: Oreochromis niloticus larvae were introduced to aquaponic (AP) and control (CP) rearing tanks (40 fish for each). When females in aquaponic and control groups (AP and CP) about to spawn, they were removed with spermiating males of their groups to continue fertilization process. After hatching (15 day old fries) were transported to their corresponding tanks. When fishes reach maturity, females from each aquaponic group as well as from the control parent and progeny were sacrificed then ovaries were used for determination of lipid content, lipid fatty acids profile as well as ratio of deformed oocytes. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at significance of (p{$<$}0.05). Results: This study showed insignificant differences in lipid class, fatty acid profile among AP and CP groups and an alteration in ovaries lipid content and class-composition of AG group relative to CG, recording significantly (p{$<$}0.05) higher triglycerides (TG) level, lowered total lipid (TL), cholesterol (COL) and phospholipid (PL) levels. Fatty acids profile alterations occurred in ovary of AG fish relative to CG fish. Saturated fatty acids significantly decrease (p{$<$}0.05) and MUFA increased (p{$<$}0.05). Levels of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Arachidonic acid (ARA) fatty acids showed insignificant variation in ovaries of aquaponic groups. Histological examination of ovaries indicated significant increase in percentage of deformed oocytes in AG group. Deformation was restricted to mature and maturing oocytes. Conclusion: Aquaponic rearing conditions affect Nile tilapia progeny reared to maturity in this type of system, causing significant decrease in total lipid content, altered fatty acid classes and fatty acids profile and increase percentage of deformed oocytes.},

  abstract = {Modern agriculture, such as aquaponics, has become a well-known solution nowadays for farming, especially in Asia countries. It provides an alternative to support food demands and maintain environmental sustainability. However, it requires manpower and time to maintain and monitor the system. This research proposes a smart automation aquaponic monitoring system that helps users maintain and monitor the system through smartphone applications. The system uses DHT11 to record temperature and humidity, HC-SR04 for water level, and FC-28 to maintain soil moisture. The sensors are integrated with WeMos D1 Wi-Fi Uno based ESP8266 microcontroller to process the data. The data collected is stored in the cloud and retrieved via the Blynk application, which also performs as an actuator and allows users to control the parameters involved. The application helps to monitor the humidity, temperature, and water level in the fish tank and control the actuator for feeding fish. The system also sends a notification to the user for any activities performed, such as watering plants, feeding fish, and abnormality of temperature in the surroundings. The performance of the system was evaluated using regression modeling. The result indicates positive growth for both plants and fish during the monitoring duration, suggesting the proposed system's effectiveness. Overall, this solution helps to reduce manpower and operation costs as well as alternatives for food demand and stabilize environmental sustainability, especially in the urban residency.},

  abstract = {Climate change is an inevitable event that obstructs the output of aquaculture farms and culture-based fisheries in open waters. It poses a serious threat to global food security, altering biodiversity, ecosystems, and global fish output by displacing fish stocks from their natural habitats. When compared to freshwater aquaculture, marine/coastal aquaculture is more affected. To combat the effects of climate change, several mitigation methods and adaptations are being implemented, emphasizing future demands of affordable protein. Selective breeding, species diversification, and aquaculture systems like integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, aquaponics, and recirculating aquaculture system are some of the most widely accepted and adapted solutions. Further research on intervention in seed and feed in terms of quality improvement, bioresource utilization, and technological and genetic improvement is required. Climate change policies from the government are also essential. The present study differs from previous reviews by portraying the various abiotic stress factors contributing to the drastic climate change, encompassing adaptation strategies followed in distinct aquaculture sources such as freshwater, inland saline water, brackish water, coastal waters, and culture-based capture fisheries with its future implications.},

  abstract = {Availability of freshwater is the prime mover of the human life activities. The advances in desalination technologies clearly show that desalinated water can be used as a substitute for freshwater to be used as potable water. A breakthrough in reverse osmosis costs has been reached, particularly in decreasing energy consumption. The introduction of nanotechnology in the membrane manufacture has resulted in reducing the volume of rejected brine which in turn alleviates the brine disposal issue. Several recent studies show that desalinated water for development of isolated areas is economically competitive to transportation of freshwater by pipeline. The introduction of solar energy to power desalination process has given a new dimension to the expansion of desalination technology. Several studies show the importance of solar desalination in countries suffering from freshwater shortage, particularly in isolated areas. This chapter presents an overview of desalination technologies with emphasis on solar energy-driven units. Some case studies are highlighted. The chapter concludes with a discussion of future avenues in solar desalination.},

  abstract = {Wastewater from domestic developments, farms and agro-industrial processing can be sources of pollution in the environment; current wastewater management methods are usually machine-based, and thus energy consuming. When Permaculture Principles are used in the creation of water purification and harvesting systems, there can be multiple environmental and economic benefits. In the context of energy descent, it may be considered desirable to treat wastewater using minimal energy. The constructed wetland design presented here is a low-entropy system in which wastewater is harvested and transformed into lush and productive wetland, eliminating the requirement for non-renewable energy in water purification, and also maximising benefits: biodiversity, flood resilience and yield. In permaculture design, the high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds in sewage are viewed as valuable nutrients, resources to be harvested by a constructed wetland ecosystem and converted into useful yield. Similarly, rainwater runoff is not viewed as a problem which can cause flooding, but as a potential resource to be harvested to provide a yield. This paper presents a case study, with both water quality and productivity data, from Brookside Farm UK, where the use of Permaculture Design Principles has created a combined wastewater management and purification system, accepting all site water.},

Existing aquaculture has been a continuous source of environmental degradation; however, minimal concern has been documented toward its waste management. This paper aims to review the fundamental aspects of aquaponics, its components, types and influencing factors, and also to estimate potential nitrogen recovery from aquaponics. This review also explores the nitrogen transformation pathway and discusses potential challenges for aquaponics in Nepal. The estimated the nitrogen recovery potential of aquaponics in Nepal are 3509 tonnes (t) and 7157t, equivalent to 7628t and 15558t of urea fertilizer for the years 2020 and 2030, respectively. Globally, nitrogen loss from aquaculture was estimated to be 7.52\,×\,106 t for 2016. Developing countries like India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, etc. are also major source of existing nitrogen loss from aquaculture. For environmental and production sustainability, wastewater utilization via aquaponics is crucial, therefore, needs global attention and policy formulation. Identification of isotopic signature or abundance of stable isotopes in aquaponics helps find the exact pathway of nitrogen transformation in the system.},

Moreover, it argues that this debate needs to be looked at from the food system as a whole and at the corporate sector’s interest to control the whole food system. The way the concept of ‘food sovereignty’ was developed to counter the control of the corporate sector on local agricultural production, the concept of ‘seed sovereignty’ can equally be deployed to save the local genotype, maintain agro-biodiversity and agro-ecology and produce healthy food in an ecologically and climate change-adaptive ways. As the seed is basic to the whole food system, the corporate agricultural sector is precisely hitting at the seed sovereignty of farmers so that they become dependent on them, eventually leading to their monopolistic control over the food system. Therefore, the paper argues that the major concern should be focused on farmers’ seed sovereignty as the first step towards sustainable agriculture.},

  author = {Aiveca Sánchez, Henrique Junior},

  institution = {{Universidade Nova de Lisboa}},
  abstract = {The main objective of this thesis is to study the developing fields of aquaponics and its potential  for aquaculture wastewater treatment and human urine treatment.     Aquaponics is a food production system which combines fish farming (aquaculture) with  soilless crop farming (hydroponics). In this thesis the concept of aquaponics and the underlying  processes are explained. Research on aquaculture wastewater and human urine wastewater is  reviewed and its potential application with aquaponic systems is studied. An overview of the  different types of aquaponic systems and current research on the field is also presented.     A case study was conducted in a farm in Askeröd, Sweden, which involved building two  aquaponic systems (System 1 and System 2) and a human urine-based aquaponic system  (System 3), with different degrees of component complexity and sizes. The design, building and  monitoring of System 1, System 2 and System 3 was documented and described in detail. Four  day experiments were conducted which tested the evolution in concentration of Total Ammonia  Nitrogen (NH4+/NH3), Nitrite (NO2-), Nitrate (NO3-), Phosphate (PO43-), and Dissolved Oxygen  (O2) after an initial nutrient input. The goal was to assess the concentrations of these parameters  after four days and compare them with relevant literature examples in the aquaculture industry  and in source-separated urine research.     Neither of the two aquaponic systems (System 1 and System 2) displayed all of the parameter  concentrations in the last day of testing below reference values found in literature. The best  performing of the aquaponic systems was the more complex system (System 2) combining the  hydroponic Nutrient Film Technique with a Deep Water Culture component, with a Total  Ammonia Nitrogen concentration of 0,20 mg/L, a Nitrite concentration of 0,05 mg/L, a Nitrate  concentration of 1,00-5,00 mg/L, a Phosphate concentration of {$<$}0,02 mg/L and a Dissolved  Oxygen concentration of 8,00 mg/L. The human urine-based aquaponic system (System 3)  underperformed in achieving the reference concentration values in literature for most  parameters. The removal percentage between the higher recorded values after the input addition  and the final day of testing was calculated for two literature examples of separated urine  treatment and System 3. The system had a removal percentage of 75\% for Total Ammonia  Nitrogen, 98\% for Nitrite, 25\% for Nitrate and 50\% for Phosphate. These percentages still  underperformed literature examples in most of the tested parameters.    The results gathered allowed to conclude that while aquaculture wastewater treatment and  human urine treatment is possible with aquaponics systems, overall these did not perform as  well as some examples found in recirculating aquaculture systems and source-separated urine  treatment literature. However, better measuring techniques, longer testing periods and more  research is recommended in this field in order to draw an improved representative conclusion.},

  abstract = {The aquaponic system is an alternative strategy to treat aquaculture waste and achieve food independence. Bacteria play vital roles in the aquaponic system as they can transform ammonia or ammonium into nitrite and then into nitrate, which is more favorable for bacteria, fish, and plants. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas europaea Winogradsky and Nitrobacter winogradskyi Winslow) on the aquaponic system in terms of water quality, nutrient availability, and productivity of carp (Cyprinus carpio), lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. crispa), and vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides L.). The experiment consisted of four treatments: aquaculture of carp as a control for fish (A), hydroponic of lettuce and vetiver grass without nutrient addition as a control for plants (B), aquaponic (carp, lettuce, vetiver grass) (C), and aquaponic with nitrifying bacteria addition (D). The results showed nitrifying bacteria addition had a significant effect on daily growth rate (DGR) and relative growth rate (RGR) of lettuce within a treatment; on the other hand, the nitrifying bacteria did not give a significant effect to RGR of vetiver grass. The growth rate, specific growth rate, and survival rate of the carp in aquaculture treatment (A) were lower than in both aquaponic treatments (C and D). Nitrifying bacteria addition in the aquaponics system had a significant effect of increasing the orthophosphate concentration. Water quality was also indicated to be better in the aquaponic system than in the aquaculture system. The integration of aquaculture and hydroponics with the addition of nitrifying bacteria enables the formation of microorganism communities, nitrate, and orthophosphate, which lead to the improvement of water quality, nutrient availability, and plant growth.},

Only brick lets was used as media in treatment T1, whereas in treatment T2 media had mixture of brick lets and used tea leaves. Six 20 liter plastic containers and a 750 L water tank were used for vegetable bed and fish rearing respectively. Fish and water spinach were sampled fortnightly. The highest average plant height, weight and number of leaves recorded in T1 were 35.96 ± 4.75 cm, 59.09 + 23.85 g and 93.90 + 38.52, respectively. Total production of water spinach in T1 and T2 was 1.26 and 0.98 kg, respectively. At the end of the experiment, \% length and weight gain was 33.81 and 174.06, the survival rate and FCR was found to be 98.33\% and 1.56, respectively. The total production of fish was 29.44 tons/ha/90 days. The system produced higher amount of fish as well as vegetable with minimum water use having no environmental pollution. The system efficiently utilized fish waste in plant production through a symbiotic relationship between the fish and plants. Therefore, the system could be installed in high density city areas to produce fish and vegetable from the rooftop and backyard to address the environmental problems.

  abstract = {An indoor aquaponic system (i.e., the integration of fish culture with hydroponic plant production in a recirculating setup) was operated for maximizing water reuse and year-round intensive food production (Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, and leaf lettuce) at different fish feed to plants ratios. The system consisted of a fish culture component, solid removal component, and hydroponic component comprising six long channels with floating styrofoam rafts for holding plants. Fish culture effluents flowed by gravity from the fish culture component to the solid removal component and then to the hydroponic component. Effluents were collected in a sump from which a 1-horsepower in-line pump recirculated the water back to the fish culture tanks at a rate of about 250 L/min. The hydroponic component performed as biofilter and effectively managed the water quality. Fish production was staggered to harvest one of the four fish tanks at regular intervals when fish attained a minimum weight of 250 g. Out of the total eight harvests in 13 mo, net fish production per harvest averaged 33.5 kg/m3 of water with an overall water consumption of 320 L/kg of fish produced along with the production of leaf lettuce at 42 heads/m2 of hydroponic surface area. Only 1.4\% of the total system water was added daily to compensate the evaporation and transpiration losses. A ratio of 56 g fish feed/m2 of hydroponic surface effectively controlled nutrient buildup in the effluents. However, plant density could be decreased from 42 to 25–30 plants/m2 to produce a better quality lettuce.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the emerging need for vertical farms by examining issues related to food security, urban population growth, farmland shortages, “food miles”, and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Urban planners and agricultural leaders have argued that cities will need to produce food internally to respond to demand by increasing population and to avoid paralyzing congestion, harmful pollution, and unaffordable food prices. The paper examines urban agriculture as a solution to these problems by merging food production and consumption in one place, with the vertical farm being suitable for urban areas where available land is limited and expensive. Luckily, recent advances in greenhouse technologies such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics have provided a promising future to the vertical farm concept. These high-tech systems represent a paradigm shift in farming and food production and offer suitable and efficient methods for city farming by minimizing maintenance and maximizing yield. Upon reviewing these technologies and examining project prototypes, we find that these efforts may plant the seeds for the realization of the vertical farm. The paper, however, closes by speculating about the consequences, advantages, and disadvantages of the vertical farm’s implementation. Economic feasibility, codes, regulations, and a lack of expertise remain major obstacles in the path to implementing the vertical farm.},

  abstract = {Supply systems for water, energy and food in the Gulf region are becoming highly interlinked. In the last decades, interdependence was evident in the increase of coproduction plants and the cross-sectoral resource use footprints. In light of increasing integration due to growing scarcities, the construction of mega projects for coproduction, and the use of renewables across sectors, the security notion can be revisited. This paper proposes a view of the resource supply security based on the systems’ characteristics under change and their ability to deal with risks and shocks (resilience). It introduces internal and external risk factors for the water, energy and food supply systems in the Gulf region and highlights recent knowledge on such risks. Further, the paper explains the vulnerability of supply systems to planning risks like scale, integration intensity and level of service provisions together with risks related to growth, technology, market and climate. In light of such insecurities, we stress the importance of investing in risk management and resilience policies in infrastructure planning. Response measures to future risks can focus on options like storage, knowledge, diversification and, importantly, promoting regional cooperation and synergies from common infrastructure planning between countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).},

  abstract = {Shrimp aquaculture has been the fastest growing and diversifying food production industry in the world. On the other hand, basil is an important herb moderately salt-tolerant, which is among the most main crops which essential oils stand out for the quality and chemical diversity. This paper evaluates the performance of an aquaponic shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)-basil (Ocimum basilicum) system in terms of water quality, water use, and nutrient removal. This aquaponic system consists of three units (aquaculture; water conditioning; and hy­ droponic) coupled in a recirculation system using low-salinity water: well water (WW) and diluted seawater (DSW). The experiment was conducted over 78 days to characterize the performance of the proposed system, which reduces \textasciitilde 73\% and 76\% of the organic suspended solids, 23\% and 18\% of the total phosphorous (TP), and 24\% and 21\% of total nitrogen (TN) for WW and DSW, respectively. The reduction of TN and TP in the system implies a great efficiency in the use of nutrients, and consequently a low environmental impact. The water use by the shrimp biomass was 2.7 and 3.0 m3 kg− 1 for WW and DSW, respectively, while by the total biomass (shrimp + basil) was 0.5 and 0.8 m3 kg− 1 for WW and DSW, respectively. These results evidence that aquaponic shrimpbasil system remove N and P from water, improve water quality, enable efficient use of water and nutrients, reduce effluent discharge to the environment, as well as increase production.},

  abstract = {Urban agriculture (UA) initiatives have been increasing in recent years as a nature-based solution for achieving many of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals. However, climate change is expected to have effects on rainfall patterns, which are likely to impact urban food production. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate how issues related to water sources for UA have been addressed in the scientific literature from two different so­ cioeconomic and environmental realities, Brazil and Italy. The method involved a systematic literature review, considering the PRISMA guidelines. The Web of Science database and papers’ reference lists were used for retrieving original articles, published in 2000–2020 interval, indexed on scientific databases, and containing data on the typology and quality of water sources used in UA studies. After applying the eligibility criteria, 191 papers were selected – Brazil (108) and Italy (83). The last five years have seen an intensification of studies into issues involving water. Tap water has been identified as an important source of irrigation water for UA, if not the main one. No studies were found that addressed the impact of UA on public water supply systems. The findings point towards more sustainable practices involving the reuse of water and adaptive practices towards water security. We identified that innovative production systems like container farming, aquaponics and indoor agriculture, as well as cultivation of fruit trees, wild edible plants and varieties with low water requirements can represent water-saving options.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponic systems where, in general terms, the waste produced by aquatic organisms becomes nutrients through bacterial action for plant growth. Water consumption as well as the environmental impact in this type of system are lower compared to more traditional hydroponic and aquaculture counterparts, due to its dual productive nature and closed condition of the system allowing the reuse of water and fish waste. The present study evaluated the yield, nitrate concentration, microbiological and functional quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in two production systems: aquaponics and hydroponics. At the same time, fresh mass gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were assessed. Lettuces were grown in an aquaponic system using waste water from the fish system, as well as in a hydroponic system with nutrient solution (Hoagland II-modified) both for 21 days. At the end of this period, baby lettuce (8 and 12 cm of length) was harvested. The yield of lettuce grown in aquaponic system was 6.73\% higher than that of grown in hydroponic system. Also aquaponically grown lettuce had lower nitrate concentration (1079 mg kg-1 FW) than hydroponically grown lettuce (1229 mg kg-1 FW). Lettuces grown in both systems showed no significant differences in the microbial and functional qualities. Rainbow trout in the aquaponic system increased 13.6 g over 27.1±0.8 g initial fresh weight, obtaining a FCR of 0.74 after the experiment. These results indicate that the aquaponic system used in the present study is a sustainable alternative for the production of high quality lettuce considering its high yield, lower concentration of nitrates and similar microbiological and functional qualities compared to hydroponic systems, while allowing simultaneous fish farming with a good feed conversion ratio (74 g of food was needed to produce 100 g of rainbow trout).},

In areas where natural light is not sufficient for optimal plant growth and production, high pressure sodium (HPS) light sources are widely used. However, HPS lamps are considered not very electrically efficient generating high radiant heat and as a consequence, there has been a lot of interest in replacing HPS lamps with new more efficient lighting sources in the form of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The effects of three lighting sources (White LED, Blue/Red LED and HPS) on the growth, development and on the essential oil yield and quality of sweet basil and bush basil were investigated. There was a clear advantage to the Blue/Red (452 nm and 632 nm, respectively) LED on virtually all growth and physiological parameters measured for both basil species. The HPS lighting system always performed least effectively in all comparisons. Combining increases in plant yield and increases in oil yield the Blue/Red LED array outperformed the HPS lights by a factor of approximately double, with the white LED being intermediate between these two extremes.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic Cultivation Technology can be done inside the house or outside the home, this cultivation also produces plants and fish that can be used by the community with urban farming on local food. Aquaponic system fish farming is a culture system that can save land use and increase the efficiency of nutrient utilization from the rest of the feed and fish metabolism. The purpose is to design water temperature sensors on aeroponics and to test temperature sensors by validating others.. The design of an early warning system application due to a landslide there are several stages, namely: first, Designing a DS18B20 sensor on acuponics. Second, Testing the DS18B20. The measurement results will be stored on the scratchpad and read by the device. This sensor can measure temperatures in the range 0 ° -50 ℃. Microcontroller functions as an electronic circuit controller and stores the program in it. Microcontroller is called a single chip because the microcontroller has a memory and I / O devices. The test was carried out using a container containing chunks of ice. The test was carried out safely for 15 minutes and data was taken every minute. Testing the DS18B20 sensor with a comparison sensor found an average error of 0.0409 with a standard deviation of 0.08023. The results of the measurement of small error errors presented that the DS18B20 sensor can be used properly.},

  abstract = {Agricultural science has significantly evolved in the last years. Innovative greenhouse systems -such as hydroponics and aquaponics- that improve both efficiency and effectiveness are being used in the cultivation of crops. However, those systems are mostly utilised by large production companies as they are the ones who have the technical knowledge and awareness of their use and benefit. In a modern society, and in order to promote agriculture activities to the public, traditional ways (such as leaflets, websites etc.) to promote systems such as hydroponics are not very effective as it would be expected and desired. We propose to promote hydroponics using a game-based learning approach, with the implementation of a game that educates users in an engaging way about hydroponics systems and ways that they can be developed and operate. To raise awareness on hydroponics, we developed an educational game that promotes and delivers educational material through exciting gameplay and intriguing story-telling, as opposed to direct teaching and information dissemination. Initial testing results show that players – regardless of their interest in hydroponics – enjoy the overall experience of the developed game, and are open to learning about hydroponics through this medium. A broader testing process is set for future work.},

Hydroponic growing systems use mineral nutrient solutions to feed the plants in water of using soilless media. While Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics. Many studies of commercial-scale hydroponic, aeroponics and aquaponics production showed the potential positives role for those new technologies in the sustainable food security. Those agricultural farming systems could be one sustainable alternative to provide different type of produces that it requires less water, less fertilizer and less space which will increase the yield per unit area.

Aquaponic system is a system that offers solutions related to narrow land use and limited water resources for fish and plant cultivation activities. In this community service activity, the aquaponics system was introduced to the community in the Dahanrejo area, with several activities carried out including the creation of an aquaponics unit, counseling and training given to the community on this aquaponics technique and unit. In carrying out community service activities there are several stages that need to be carried out including: location surveying, designing and testing of acuponic technology, counseling and training, monitoring and surveying. From the activities carried out, 20 people received training on how to use the land for freshwater fish cultivation and crop cultivation using aquaponics technology. In addition, an aquaponic unit was handed over to the kelurahan as a model for the existing community.},

  abstract = {As the world’s population is increasing exponentially, human diets have changed to less healthy foods resulting in detrimental health complications. Increasing vegetable intake by both rural and urban dwellers can help address this issue. However, these communities often face the challenge of limited vegetable supply and accessibility. More so, open field vegetable production cannot supply all the vegetable needs because biotic and abiotic stress factors often hinder production. Alternative approaches such as vegetable production in greenhouses, indoor farms, high tunnels, and screenhouses can help fill the gap in the supply chain. These alternative production methods provide opportunities to use less resources such as land space, pesticide, and water. They also make possible the control of production factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide, as well as extension of the growing season. Some of these production systems also make the supply and distribution of nutrients to crops easier and more uniform to enhance crop growth and yield. This paper reviews these alternative vegetable production approaches which include hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics and soilless mixes to reveal the need for exploring them further to increase crop production. The paper also discusses facilities used, plant growth factors, current challenges including energy costs and prospects.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture and hydroponics have experienced significant growth and market presence in recent years. While aquaponics, the combination of fish and plant culture systems, is beginning to experience the same exponential growth and interest that hydroponics did many years ago, very little information is available on sizing and design of these systems. Incorporation of hydroponic plants with recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) aids in removal of ammonia/ammonium based wastes, thus reducing the need for water discharge to control water quality. Surface only nitrification rates were quantified to be 0.83g/m2/day for inert surfaces and 0.20/m2/day for root surfaces. Direct assimilation of ammonia by the lettuce plants was less than 2\% of the total ammonia and ammonium nitrogen (TAN) removed from the culture water, with the remainder being removal by oxidation of TAN into nitrate.},

Thus, more attention should be paid to production costs, especially with nutrition and food, which have 40-70\% of the total cost. Tilapia need several nutrients for proper growth, reproduction and health, such as essential amino acids for the formation and regeneration of most tissues and fish specific proteins; energy for maintaining the basic metabolism and proper growth; essential fatty acids that are components of cell membranes and energy source; minerals which are important for the formation of bones and teeth; Vitamins in general, which act as activators or enzyme components in different metabolic processes. The requirements of these nutrients are dependent on several factors such as: development phase of the fish species, water temperature, among others.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an innovative application for spent coffee grounds (SCGs) used as filler for the formulation of lightweight clay ceramic aggregates (LWA). LWA can be used for urban and agricultural purposes as a sustainable solution. Spent coffee grounds were tested as a pore forming agent partially acting as a replacement for red clay in material formulation before firing. Substitutions of 10, 15, and 20 wt.\% of red clay were tested. The properties of lightweight aggregates with 15 wt.\% of SCGs were improved using a specifically tailored fertilizer glass due to its low pH and conductivity within the soil tolerance range. Packaging glassy sand, cattle-bone flour ash, and potassium carbonate were mixed and melted in order to obtain this glass, which when added to the clayey batch functionalized the aggregates by phosphorus and potassium nutrients. The results (in particular, porosity and bulk density) show that the lightweight aggregates obtained have interesting properties for possible uses both in urban (e.g., green roofs as a drainage layer) and agricultural purposes. Moreover, pH and conductivity are in line with the Italian Standard regarding soil amendment (D.lgs. 75/2010). In addition, several leaching tests were performed in a solution containing 2 vol.\% citric acid (C6H8O7) to evaluate the release capacity not only of nutrients (P and K) but also to check the presence and release of heavy metals, such as lead (Pb), that may come from the glassy precursor. The results obtained showed that nutrients are efficiently released in 21 days (P = 87.73\% and K = 25.74\% of released percentage) and Pb release is under the standard threshold of 30 ppm.},

The method used in this study was completely randomized design, consisting of five treatments and each was repeated three times. The treatments were: A (without addition of filter media), B (addition of palm fibers, silica sand, and activated carbon), C (addition of palm fibers, silica sand, gravel, and activated carbon), D (addition of palm fibers, silica sand, rocks, and activated carbon), and E (addition of palm fibers, silica sand, bioball, and activated carbon). Parameters measured were: 1) the number of Nitrosomonas bacteria, 2) water quality (ammonia, nitrate, and phosphate); and, 3) productivity of fish and Chinese spinach. Data were analyzed using a descriptive method. The findings show that the highest number of bacteria was found in treatment E, 9.29×105 CFU/mL on the bioball filter media and 4.43×105 CFU/mL in rearing tanks. The best water quality was in treatment B, with a concentration of ammonia of 0.17 mg/L, nitrate of 0.33 mg/L, and phosphate of 0.54 mg/L. Plant productivity was the best in treatment B in which the average length and weight reach 48.1 cm and 11.1 grams of plant/week, respectively. The best fish growth was seen in treatment C with an absolute growth rate of 4.4 grams and a specific growth rate of 1.9\%/day. The recommended filter was made of Arenga pinnata fibers, silica sand, gravels, and active carbon of about 2 cm thick each.The results showed that the type of filter on the aquaponic system had an effect on the amount of Nitrosomonas sp. in water, water quality, and the productivity of Chinese spinach.},

This study aims to determine the productivity of water plants at various stocking density ratios in the aquaponic culture system. This study is conducted experimentally using the Completely Randomized Design with the differences in the treatment of stocking density ratio, each repeated five times. The treatments of the stocking density ratio of both the catfish fry and the Nile tilapia fry include: A (75:75 fry/m2), B (100:50 fry/m2, and C (125:25 fry/m2). The observed parameters are 1) plant productivity including measuring the growth of water spinach and growth rate, covering weight gain, stem length and number of leaves, and 2) water quality, including dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate and phosphate. The data of plant productivity is analyzed descriptively while the water quality is analyzed using ANOVA. The result of this study shows that the stocking density ratio significantly affects the productivity of water plants and the water quality of the media. The highest productivity of water spinach productivity occurs at the stocking density ratio of 75 catfish fry/m2: 75 Nile tilapia fry m2, at which the average stem length is 59.14 cm, average number of leaves is 13.67, and the harvest weight is 465 g. Fish stocking density ratio also affects the quality of water, where the synergy between fish farming and water plant growing results in the better water quality compared to fish farming without water plant. The highest quality of water is achieved at the stocking density ratio of 100 catfish fry/m2: 50 Nile tilapia fry/m2.},

Mica is a potassium-bearing phyllosilicate mineral rock used as a fertilizer in agriculture. Four mica dose treatments of C (0 g l−1), T1 (2 g l−1), T2 (4 g l−1), and T3 (6 g l−1) were taken with equal bacterial (Bacillus megaterium) dosages of 5 × 108 CFU ml−1 in all the treatments. The experiment was performed in aquaponics units with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) stocked at 1.14 kg m−3 and 28 plants m−2, respectively. The results showed that the yield of basil was highest in T2 (365.66 ± 34.27 g), followed by T3 (362.10 ± 19.99 g), T1 (337.70 ± 15.15 g), and C (324.26 ± 16.88 g). Tilapia growth was highest in C (10.79 ± 0.35 g) followed by T1 (10.45 ± 0.12 g), T2 (10.31 ± 0.09 g), and T3 (10.18 ± 0.08 g). However, there was no significant difference in fish growth corresponding to different treatments. Thus, the treatment which showed the best compromised overall growth was T2 (4 g l−1 mica). Thus, 4 g l−1 mica can be suggested as optimum mica dose for Nile tilapia and holy basil in an aquaponic system.},

The technology is relatively new for fish culture in Kenya, and the principles and operations remain largely untested for many fish species. This study determined how stocking density affects the growth performance and water quality in a Nile tilapia-lettuce (Lactuca sativa) aquaponics system. The experimental design included five replicates for each of the aquaponic systems stocked at densities of 150, 300, and 450 fish/ m3 for a rearing period of 56 days. Each treatment had a planting density of 16 lettuce/m2. The water quality parameters ranges during the rearing period were 3.83–5.35 mg/L for dissolved oxygen, 7.44 to 7.6 for pH, 0.014 mg/L to 0.032 mg/L for total ammonium nitrate (TAN), 1.11–1.34 mg/L for nitrate, and 0.01–0.08 mg/L for nitrite, and all decreased with increasing stocking density. The final weight of fingerlings was 25.2 ± 4.2 g, 32.0 ± 3.8 g and 42.6 ± 3.1 g for 450, 300, and 150 fish/m3 respectively. Specific growth rate (SGR) was reduced with increasing stocking density whereas food conversion ratio (FCR) increased with stocking density. Aquaponic systems with the lowest stocking densities performed better than 300 and 450 fish/m3 respectively.},

  abstract = {Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) belongs to the family Solanaceae and accounts for more than half of the vegetable consumption in the United States. Traditionally, tomatoes have always been cultivated on soil. Recently, attempts have been made to incorporate value added traits for early flowering, disease resistance, and high yield of tomatoes by growing them in soil-less media with mineral nutrient solutions such as hydroponics. This method is known to offer several advantages including conservation of water, reduction of pesticide use, increased root mass and efficient uptake of nitrogen and other minerals leading to high crop yields. Until now over 50 metabolic compounds are identified that differ in organic and conventionally grown tomatoes, but there is no study that highlights the differences in the morphological characteristics, their physiological responses and protein and metabolite profiles between organic and conventionally grown tomatoes in soil and hydroponic systems. To understand how these two treatments would affect tomato’s gene expression and metabolic pathways, we performed a pilot experiment to estimate the differences in their protein and metabolite profiles and physiological responses when they were grown in soil or hydroponics. Analysis of the morphological and physiological responses such as plant height, days to flowering, number of flowers, seed weight, and fruit yield was best displayed in the organic treatment groups. However, an increased root biomass was observed in the hydroponic grow systems. A preliminary analysis of total proteins using one dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on tomato fruits indicated a differential expression of proteins among all treatments. In addition, a basic metabolic profile was obtained using high performance liquid chromatography.},

This paper presents a pilot scale evaporation technology, and investigates the feasibility of recovering nitrogen and phosphorus from human urine by solar still for use as fertilizer. After 26 days of sun exposure, 360 g of solid fertilizer material was recovered from 50 L undiluted urine. This urine-derived fertilizer was mainly composed of sodium chloride, and had phosphorus and nitrogen contents of almost 2\%. When tested with maize and ryegrass, the urine fertilizer led to biomass yields and phosphorus and nitrogen uptakes comparable to those induced by a commercial mineral fertilizer. Urine acidification with sulfuric or phosphoric acid prior treatment reduced nitrogen losses, improved the nutrient content of the generated fertilizers, and induced higher biomass yields and nitrogen and phosphorus uptakes than the commercial mineral fertilizer. However, acidification is not recommended in developing countries due to additional costs and handling risks. The fate of micropollutants and the possibility of separating sodium chloride from other beneficial nutrients require further investigation.},

  abstract = {It is difficult to analyze the complex system by using conventional tools such as field experimentation and inventory monitoring. Thus, one of the major objectives is used to develop an ecosystem model as a tool for analysis for complex systems. In view of this, the Aquacultural System Management Tool (AQUASMAT) model, which was developed based on existing ecosystem model theories and coded using the C-sharp language, was used to conduct a modeling study on a static concrete fish tank, to demonstrate its managerial and analytical capabilities. The input variables for model execution were site specific parameters, fish/feed parameters, water quality parameters and management options from selected fish farm in Nigeria. The model simulation was for concrete tanks with surface area of 1 m2 and 50 m2, respectively, running for 151 periods by using various management techniques and varied feeding rates. Series of simulations were used to evaluate the ability of the model predicting the effects of different feed regimes, management intensities, budgetary requirements (solely based on the cost of fish and feed), and interaction of parameters over a range of fish production levels. The model was used to gain insight into the dynamics and interactions of major water quality parameters with respect to feed loading and fish growth in a 1 m3 fish tank. The simulation result was compared to a farmer’s production output, and then the best management practices will be provided to the user (farmer), such as the optimal feeding techniques and practices with lower feed conversation ratio (FCR) within recommended range. The relationships and interaction between water parameters with respect to feed loading and fish growth were used to gain insight in sizing the biofilter for aquaponics systems.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness the use of pakcoy (Brassica rapa L.) and kailan (Brassica oleracea) on growth rates and feed conversion ratios by tilapia fish (Oreochromis sp.) cultivated in aquaponic aquaculture systems. The method used was an experimental design with a completely randomized using 3 treatments and 3 replications. The main parameters analyzed in this study were the specific growth rate (SGR) and the fish feed conversion ratio (FCR). Meanwhile, the supporting parameters measured include water quality variables such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. The results showed, during the maintenance of tilapia fish (Oreochromis sp.) with an aquaponic system, pakcoy (Brassica rapa L.) and kailan plants (Brassica oleracea) had an effect on increasing growth rate and feed conversion ratio by tilapia (Oreochromis sp.). In addition, during the maintenance period the water quality parameters also tend to be stabilized and comply with quality standards. The conclusion from this research is that the application of kalian plant (Brassica oleracea) use in the aquaponic system of tilapia commodities is more effective than pakcoy plants (Brassica rapa L.) with an effective SGR value at 3.15\% and an FCR value at 1.21.},

  abstract = {A vital goal of cleaner production involves developing agricultural production systems capable of ensuring sufficient yields of highly necessary foods to meet the increasing needs of the global population while minimizing the associated economic and ecological costs. Integrated agri-aquaculture systems (IAAS) offer a number of advantages for sustainable agriculture, including water reutilization, discharge mitigation, and increased profitability by leveraging the symbiotic relationship between organic waste, bacterial mineralization, and plant filtration. The aim of this study was to assess the production of two food items of global socio-economic importance cultivated at different salinities: Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grafted to salinity tolerant wild tomatoes. Pacific white shrimp were cultured at a density of 125 organisms/m3 and tomatoes at a density of 3 plants/m. The shrimp growth test consisted of three salinity levels: 2, 4, and 6 g/L. The corresponding tomato salinity treatments were conducted using shrimp water effluents; Steiner’s universal nutrient solution (SNS) was used for the control treatment. The experimental period lasted 175 days. The highest tomato production (77.46 t/ha) was attained with SNS, with no significant difference from the salinity of 2 g/L. Shrimp final mean weight, survival, and production were higher at the 6 g/L salinity; and all the other zootechnical parameters decreased with lower salinity. When compared with the hydroponic system using a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), the production costs associated with the IAAS were lower primarily because of the reduced (or null) costs of fertilizer, and irrigation water. When grafted plants were used, the salinity tolerance of the commercial hybrid increased and shrimp could be cultured at appropriate salinity to facilitate osmoregulation. Chemical fertilization requirements were reduced and acceptable yields were obtained for the tomato crop by grafting to salinity-tolerant rootstocks.},

To begin this exploration, we conducted two critical making workshops with participants who self-identified as activists and used craft materials — such as cardboard, color markers, pipe cleaners, etc.—to create speculative technologies to find commonalities across different forms of activist work, be it technological, organizational, or procedural. The needs and concerns expressed in the workshops were articulated through the participants’ designs; they materialized their critiques, reflections, and explorations through their crafted prototypes. These prototypes point to opportunities for creating new design interventions to address the challenges and needs unique to activist organizations. The work suggests the need for more value-sensitivity and context-appropriateness in the design of interactive systems.},

  abstract = {In the attempt to foster circular economy (CE), cities are increasingly adopting urban living labs (ULLs) as sites of co-production aimed at testing alternative solutions based on the reuse of products, reduction of consumption and recycling of materials. Taking this perspective, our study adopts an exploratory research design to discover the pragmatic implications emerging from a case study. The City of Turin joined proGIreg, a European project that entails the regeneration of former industrial districts by means of nature-based solutions (NBS). Ranging from aquaponics to green roofs, seven NBS have been experimented in Turin, which rely on the use of natural systems to tackle social, economic and environmental challenges efficiently and sustainably. Among them, the most promising is related to the production and test of the ‘new soil’, a blend obtained by mixing earth materials coming from construction sites with compost, zeolites and mycorrhizae. The case herein presented is interesting to analyse for the multi-stakeholder management setting used, where public institutions, private companies, research institutions, citizens and associations collaborated in the co-creation and testing phase of the NBS. Consequently, the data collected through participant observation and direct interviews allow researchers to describe multi-stakeholders’ dynamics and how they work. Thus, this paper narrates a micro-contextual experience while providing a critique. Results include an analysis of the unique combination of different stakeholders, which strongly impacted on the management and the effectiveness of the entire project. By consequence, the paper offers both theoretical contributions to the relational branch of stakeholder theory and practical evidence in demonstrating the importance of the relational branch of the theory over a more traditional transactional view.},

  abstract = {Determining whether seed production is pollen limited has been an area of intensive empirical study over the last two decades. Yet current evidence does not allow satisfactory assessment of the causes or consequences of pollen limitation. Here, we critically evaluate existing theory and issues concerning pollen limitation. Our main conclusion is that a change in approach is needed to determine whether pollen limitation reflects random fluctuations around a pollen–resource equilibrium, an adaptation to stochastic pollination environments, or a chronic syndrome caused by an environmental perturbation. We formalize and extend D. Haig and M. Westoby’s conceptual model, and illustrate its use in guiding research on the evolutionary consequences of pollen limitation, i.e., whether plants evolve or have evolved to ameliorate pollen limitation. This synthesis also reveals that we are only beginning to understand when and how pollen limitation at the plant level translates into effects on plant population dynamics. We highlight the need for both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of life-history characters, Allee effects, and environmental perturbations in population declines mediated by pollen limitation. Lastly, our synthesis identifies a critical need for research on potential effects of pollen limitation at the community and ecosystem levels.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture activities with floating net cages are considered sources of organic pollution through the accumulation of uneaten feed and excretion of fish metabolism in reservoir waters. Thus it is required to have aquaculture technology that can reduce the pollutant load of floating net cages. One of the technologies used is plants to absorb nutrients, such as aquaponics technology applied in reservoir waters. This study aimed to determine the ability of vegetables to reduce nutrients from aquaculture activities. The study was conducted in 2016 in a laboratoryscale experiment using green spinach (Amaranthus hybridus L), red spinach (Amaranthus tricolor L), pakcoy (Brassica rapa), and water spinach (Ipomea reptans) to treat nutrient waste from a carp fish culture. The results showed that the highest NO2 removal efficiency was pakcoy (98.44\%), followed by water spinach (88.15\%). The highest removal efficiency of NO3 was water spinach (69.49\%). The highest removal efficiency of PO4 was also water spinach (48.38\%), while the highest removal efficiency of total organic matter was in water spinach (42.86\%) and pakcoy (51.28\%). Water spinach plants have the highest ability to absorb nutrients N, P, and organic matter so that they can be used as nutrient-reducing plants in friendly floating net cage culture.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a technique where a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) and hydroponics are integrated to grow plants and fish in a closed system. We investigated if the growth of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea) would be affected in a coupled aquaponic system compared to the growth of the fish in RAS or plants in a hydroponic system, all systems as three replicates. We also investigated the possible effects of plants on the onset of nitrification in biofilters and on the concentration of off-flavor-causing agents geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) in rainbow trout flesh and spinach. For the fish grown in aquaponics, the weight gain and specific growth rates were higher, and the feed conversion ratio was lower than those grown in RAS. In spinach, there were no significant differences in growth between aquaponic and hydroponic treatments. The concentration of GSM was significantly higher in the roots and MIB in the shoots of spinach grown in aquaponics than in hydroponics. In fish, the concentrations of MIB did not differ, but the concentrations of GSM were lower in aquaponics than in RAS. The onset of nitrification was faster in the aquaponic system than in RAS. In conclusion, spinach grew equally well in aquaponics and hydroponic systems. However, the aquaponic system was better than RAS in terms of onset of nitrification, fish growth, and lower concentrations of GSM in fish flesh.},

A literature search was conducted in five databases with no time restriction in order to capture any publication on AP and cHP crop yield comparisons. The search was, however, limited to journal and conference articles published in English. Study characteristics and outcome measures of food crops were extracted. A natural log response ratio effect size measure was used to transform study outcomes. An unweighted meta-analysis was conducted through bootstrapping to calculate overall effect size and its confidence interval. Between-study heterogeneity (I2) was estimated using a random effects model. Subgroup and meta-regression were used to assess moderators, in an attempt to explain heterogeneity in the effect size. The results showed that although crop yield in AP was lower than conventional cHP, the difference was not statistically significant. However, drawing conclusions on the overall effect size must be done with caution due to the use of unweighted meta-analysis. There were statistically significant effects of aquatic organism, hydroponic system type, and nutrient supplementation used in the studies on crop yield comparisons. Nutrient supplementation, particularly, led to on average higher crop yield in AP relative to cHP. These findings are a vital information source for choosing factors to include in an AP study. These findings also synthesize the current trends in AP crop yields in comparison with cHP.},

  abstract = {Bangladesh is a densely populated country in the world having small land and vast water area. The country has excellent fish culture potentiality because of its abundant water resources. Currently aquaculture is being intensified in Bangladesh to meet the demand of fish protein for increasing population. Agricultural land is also being converted to other uses everyday that is creating pressure on natural resources. Lack of food security and food safety are also serious problems here. Aquaponics, as a combined system of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponics, is an innovative technology in Bangladesh which could contribute to addressing these problems. However, there is a lack of quantitative research to support the development of economically feasible aquaponic systems in the country. Although many studies have addressed some scientific aspects, there has been limited focus on commercial implementation. The analysis shows that in aquaponic system water use is minimum, fish and vegetable production per unit area is higher than the conventional aquaculture and agricultural systems. Therefore, aquaponics have ample scope of enhancement of sustainable food production, especially in adverse geographical context of Bangladesh.},

  abstract = {The merging of fish farming and crop husbandry in a mutual system forms aquaponics. In this system, the nature of the planting substrate plays a significant role in the germination, establishment, and growth of the plant. In the current experiment, the germination and growth of the Jute plant (Corchorus olitorius L.) in an aquaponics system with tilapia fish was investigated using three different substrate types: gravel, rice husk, and palm kernel shell. Five hundred-liter plastic tanks containing tilapia fingerlings at initial stocking densities of 250 fish m− 3 were used. One gram of Jute seed was sown in a 1 m2 planting trough, which contained the three substrates separately in triplicates. The troughs were flooded with water from fish holdings by an aquarium pump. The germination percentage of the jute plant on gravel substrate (84\%) and rice husk (72\%) was significantly higher (P {$<$} 0.05) compared to the palm kernel shell (55\%). A lower velocity of germination was also recorded in the palm kernel substrate. The rates of growth in height (centimeters per day) of jute plant and fresh shoot biomass yield were significantly lower on palm kernel substrate (P {$<$} 0.05). Growth and yield parameters of jute showed compar­ atively higher agronomic efficiency of gravel and rice husk substrates compared to palm kernel substrates in this research. The results indicated that substrate nature significantly affects the germination and productivity of C. olitorius in aquaponic systems and that rice husk has the potential to serve as a planting substrate in aquaponics.},

RAS-based production companies, researchers, system suppliers and consultants were interviewed separately, in order to gain an overall understanding of those systems and what developments could assist, in a positive way. Answers and subsequent analysis identified as significant barriers: poor participation by the producers; a disincentive on sharing information; and a lack of communication between different parties. The main issues are poor designs of the systems, as many had been modified after a previous approach was unsuitable; and their poor management, due mainly to an absence of skilled people taking responsibility for water quality and mechanical problems. As RAS will play an important role within the future of aquaculture, their enhancement is needed. Key priorities are the necessity to improve equipment performance, through researching at a commercial scale and further work on the best combinations of devices for each particular situation. Additional recommendations are for a specialized platform, to share knowledge on RAS, together with a more indepth and distinctive education programme.},

  abstract = {The selection of the greenhouse covering material is essential for the success of the protected horticultural production, and among the properties of a material (optical, chemical, physical, etc…) the most important for the growers are the optical properties, as they define the amount and quality of solar radiation entering the greenhouse and thus the amount of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) that will be intercepted by the crop, determining the production of dry biomass. However, there is no such a material that can be considered optimum, in terms of optical properties. Therefore, the grower has to choose a suitable covering material, with the optimum optical properties for its specific growing conditions. The most important covering materials used in horticulture in terms of covered surface in the world are flexible plastic films, glass and different types of screens. The industry is continuously incorporating new optical properties to these materials that may be of interest for the growers depending on their specific growing conditions. In the case of glass recent developments tested in The Netherlands include anti-reflection coatings, to increase the global radiation transmission at low sun radiation incident angles; new glasses have also been tested with different levels of light diffusion with none of minimum loss of global transmission, with very promising results in terms of light use efficiency by the crops, and thus, interesting yield increases. Other types of filters being tested are near infrared filters (absorption or reflection) both in glass and in plastic films, with results that suggest that reflection is preferable and that few materials are available that do not affect PAR transmission too. UV filters have provided very remarkable results in limiting the infestation by pests in plastic films. In the case of screens, a large variability of materials are available (in terms of porosity, colour of the threads, photoselective filters, etc.), and recently have been subject of different studies to understand better the combination of direct transmission of light through the pores and the interaction with the threads of the incoming radiation.},

  abstract = {The aquaponic principle is the coupling of animal aquaculture (e.g. fish) with plant production (e.g. vegetables) for saving resources. At present, various definitions of aquaponics exist, some bearing the risk of misinterpretation by dismissing the original meaning or being contradictory. In addition, there is no standard terminology for the aspects of coupling between the aquaponic subsystems. In this study, we addressed both issues. (1) We developed new or revised definitions that are summarised by: Aquaponic farming comprises aquaponics (which couples tank-­based animal aquaculture with hydroponics) and trans-­aquaponics, which extends aquaponics to tankless aquaculture as well as non-­hydroponics plant cultivation methods. Within our conceptual system, the term aquaponics corresponds to the definitions of FAO and EU. (2) A system analysis approach was utilised to explore different aquaponic setups aiming to better describe the way aquaponic subsystems are connected. We introduced the new terms ‘coupling type’ and ‘coupling degree’, where the former qualitatively characterises the water-­mediated connections of aquaponic subsystems. A system with on-­demand nutrient water supply for the independent operating plant cultivation is an ‘on-­demand coupled system’ and we propose to deprecate the counterintuitive term ‘decoupled system’ for this coupling type. The coupling degree comprises a set of parameters to quantitatively determine the coupling's efficiency of internal streams, for example, water and nutrients. This new framework forms a basis for improved communication, provides a uniform metric for comparing aquaponic facilities, and offers criteria for facility optimisation. In future system descriptions, it will simplify evaluation of the coupling's contribution to sustainability of aquaponics.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;The concept of the circular city (CC) can be employed to mitigate the impact of the Food-Water-Energy Nexus on the environment at the local as well as the global level. The CC is based on circular economy (CE) ideas, where one of the key elements is coupling: unused and/or waste output of CE-entities can be used as input to other CE-entities. Due to the nature of some CE-entities, they need to be located in the proximity of other suitable CE-entities within the build environment.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Policies and strategies on the level of the EU, city, or district deliver an orientation; zoning law and building codes sets the legal frame when integrating a CE undertaking into the urban fabric. Based on the requirements of a planned CE-entity with a known configuration at a given location, comprehensive information is needed (1) on the infrastructure available, (2) where other usable CE-entities are situated, and (3) which qualities and respective quantities they offer. This may be, to name few, separate sewerage equipped buildings able to deliver grey water or facilities with excess heat on the output side; or entities which accept organic waste as input, e.g. biogas plants.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;A site resource inventory using different data would unveil urban sources available on a given site to support business location decisions. One data source for a site resource inventory is the geodata infrastructure maintained by the authorities, e.g. the Berlin Geodata Portal. Information is centrally collected and published; but that comes with some restrictions: a rather fixed information structure, low update rate, and no means for user conducted error corrections. A further data source is volunteered geographic information as provided by OpenSteetMap (OSM), where every user can add and change content. OSM relies heavily on tags which describe specific features of map elements, but the standard tags of OSM are of only little use for the CC. Recently an ongoing project on OSM improve the semantic granularity by the introduction of specific CE-tags. This CE-project puts the main focus on locations. But there is further need for extending the range of the tags to enable CC siting by supporting attributes of CE-entities with regard to their material flows.\&amp;\#160;\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The CC food sector and likewise urban agriculture (UA) bears potential towards sustainability if resource efficient food production technologies are used as CE-entities such as aquaponics, the coupled production of fish and vegetables.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Agriculture In the rural environment often uses single-story buildings which are inappropriate in urban contexts where low land consumption is required. On the next level, the roofs, there is much unused space available but competing claims are made, such as green roofs, recreation, housing, thermal and photovoltaic solar use as well as UA solutions like greenhouses. Urban aquaponics as a CE-entity is used exemplarily to propose OSM tags which can evolve to a CE tagging system - thus manifesting a new geodata management approach for a circular city.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract = {Abstract. A circular city builds upon the principles of circular economy, which key concepts of reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover lead to a coupling of resources: products and by-products of one production process become the input of another one, often in local vicinity. However, sources, types and available quantities of underutilised resources in cities are currently not well documented. Therefore, there is a missing link in the information flow of the circular city between potential users and site-specific data. To close this gap, this study introduces the concept of a site resource inventory in conjunction with a new information model that can manage the data needed for advancing the circular city. A core taxonomy of terms is established as the foundation for the information model: the circular economy is defined as a network of circular economy entities which are regarded as black boxes and connected by their material and energy inputs and outputs. This study proposes a site resource inventory, which is a collection of infrastructural and building-specific parameters that assess the suitability of urban sites for a specific circular economy entity. An information model is developed to manage the data that allows the entities to effectively organise the allocation and use of resources within the circular city and its material and energy flows. The application of this information model was demonstrated by comparing the demand and availability of required alternative resources (e.g. greywater) at a hypothetical site comprising a commercial aquaponic facility (synergistic coupling of fish and vegetables production) and a residential building. For the implementation of the information model a proposal is made which uses the publicly available geodata infrastructure of OpenStreetMap and adopts its tag system to operationalise the integration of circular economy data by introducing new tags. A site resource inventory has the potential to bring together information needs and it is thus intended to support companies when making their business location decisions or to support local authorities in the planning process.},

  abstract = {The UVI Commercial Aquaponic System is designed to produce fish and vegetables in a recirculating aquaculture system. The integration of these systems intensifies production in a small land area, conserves water, reduces waste discharged into the environment, and recovers nutrients from fish production into valuable vegetable crops. A standard protocol has been developed for the production of tilapia yielding 5 MT per annum. The production of many vegetable crops has also been studied but, because of specific growth patterns and differences of marketable product, no single protocol can be promoted. Each crop yields different value per unit area and this must be considered when selecting varieties to produce to provide the highest returns to the farmer. Variables influencing the value of a crop are density (plants/m2), yield (unit or kg), production period (weeks) and unit value (\$). Combining these variables to one unit, \$/m2/week, provides a common point for comparison among crops. Farmers can focus production efforts on the most valuable crops or continue to produce a variety of crops meeting market demand with the knowledge that each does not contribute equally to profitability.},

  abstract = {An open-field cultivation combined-type aquaponic system (OCAS) was developed to effectively utilize saline groundwater and prevent soil salinization while ensuring food production in drylands. To achieve the sustainable food production of the OCAS in power-scarce areas, a stand-alone photovoltaic system (PVS) for the OCAS was designed through a feasibility study of utilizing solar energy to meet its power demand. As a case study, the OCAS was established in La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, with power consumption 22.72 kWh/day and annual average daily global horizontal irradiation (GHI) 6.12 kWh/m2/day, considering the 2017 meteorological data. HOMER software was employed for performance analysis and techno-economic evaluation of an appropriate PVS. Thousands PVS configurations were evaluated in terms of total net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (COE). The PVS that fulfilled the power demand and had the smallest NPC was proposed, for which the NPC and COE were calculated as \$46,993 and \$0.438/kWh, respectively. The relationship between its annual power supply and power demand of the OCAS was also analyzed in detail. It was found that the operation hours and the amount of power generation by the proposed PVS were 4156 h and 19,106 kWh in one year. Additionally, it was predicted that the excess power would occur almost every afternoon and reach 43\% of the generated power. Therefore, the COE can be further reduced by rationally utilizing the excess power during operation.},

Experimental units were set up with different amounts of supplemented organic and inorganic (complex minerals) nutrients to carry out the study. The results indicated that desirable growth of M. rosenbergii might be possible in RA systems when supplied sufficient levels of macro-micro nutrients. Analyses of nutrients in the prawn culture tanks demonstrated that ammonia and nitrate concentrations were critical in maintaining proper water quality during the culture period. Five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5) increased significantly with the increased loading of organic supplement in the rearing tanks. A significant linear relationship of chlorophyll a and N:P ratio was observed among the treatments. The combination of complex minerals and organic chicken manure (CM15) displayed a higher N:P ratio, maximal total yield and did not show adverse effects of NH3 concentrations and other important water quality parameters.},

This research work attempts to develop a smart aquaponics system that combines conventional aquaculture with hydroponics. The system uses the Internet of Things to continuously sense and control the environment and to provide real-time feedback and alerts to the owner through a mobile application. It features a camera surveillance system that enables live streaming of the aquaponics setup and also allows for further image processing. Through the captured images, the system performs leaf recognition identifying the type of the leaf. Moreover, the system also performs disease detection that identifies if the leaf, and consequently the plant, is suffering from a specific disease. If the system detects a disease, it automatically generates a report which is sent to the owner through the mobile application. The prototype has been tested and looks very promising. We hope that this work paves the way towards a smart aquaponics system that detects, identifies and notifies the owner of possible diseases at early stage before their propagation.},

  abstract = {Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are unique engineered ecosystems that minimize environmental perturbation by reducing nutrient pollution discharge. RAS typically employ a biofilter to control ammonia levels produced as a byproduct of fish protein catabolism. Nitrosomonas (ammonia-oxidizing), Nitrospira, and Nitrobacter (nitrite-oxidizing) species are thought to be the primary nitrifiers present in RAS biofilters. We explored this assertion by characterizing the biofilter bacterial and archaeal community of a commercial scale freshwater RAS that has been in operation for {$>$}15 years. We found the biofilter community harbored a diverse array of bacterial taxa ({$>$}1000 genus-level taxon assignments) dominated by Chitinophagaceae (∼12\%) and Acidobacteria (∼9\%). The bacterial community exhibited significant composition shifts with changes in biofilter depth and in conjunction with operational changes across a fish rearing cycle. Archaea also were abundant, and were comprised solely of a low diversity assemblage of Thaumarchaeota ({$>$}95\%), thought to be ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) from the presence of AOA ammonia monooxygenase genes. Nitrosomonas were present at all depths and time points. However, their abundance was {$>$}3 orders of magnitude less than AOA and exhibited significant depth-time variability not observed for AOA. Phylogenetic analysis of the nitrite oxidoreductase beta subunit (nxrB) gene indicated two distinct Nitrospira populations were present, while Nitrobacter were not detected. Subsequent identification of Nitrospira ammonia monooxygenase alpha subunit genes in conjunction with the phylogenetic placement and quantification of the nxrB genotypes suggests complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox) and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira populations co-exist with relatively equivalent and stable abundances in this system. It appears RAS biofilters harbor complex microbial communities whose composition can be affected directly by typical system operations while supporting multiple ammonia oxidation lifestyles within the nitrifying consortium.},

  abstract = {As the processes facilitated by plant growth promoting microorganisms (PGPMs) become better characterized, it is evident that PGPMs may be critical for successful sustainable agricultural practices. Microbes enrich plant growth through various mechanisms, such as enhancing resistance to disease and drought, producing beneficial molecules, and supplying nutrients and trace metals to the plant rhizosphere. Previous studies of PGPMs have focused primarily on soil-based crops. In contrast, aquaponics is a water-based agricultural system, in which production relies upon internal nutrient recycling to co-cultivate plants with fish. This arrangement has management benefits compared to soil-based agriculture, as system components may be designed to directly harness microbial processes that make nutrients bioavailable to plants in downstream components. However, aquaponic systems also present unique management challenges. Microbes may compete with plants for certain micronutrients, such as iron, which makes exogenous supplementation necessary, adding production cost and process complexity, and limiting profitability and system sustainability. Research on PGPMs in aquaponic systems currently lags behind traditional agricultural systems, however, it is clear that certain parallels in nutrient use and plant-microbe interactions are retained from soil-based agricultural systems.},

  abstract = {Very little is known about pollination and its effects on the yield and physicochemical properties of flowering plants in tropical countries. Wind and insect pollinators are among our natural resources because pollination is the most important ecosystem service performed by wind and insects, and is vital to the socio-economic status of human beings. In this experiment, different pollination methods for tomato plants were examined. Self-pollination was encouraged by covering the plants with a plastic sheet. Wind and insects were excluded from these plants, and thus only self-pollination was possible. The experiment occurred during the flowering stage. Wind-pollinated plants were covered with a muslin cloth, which excluded insects, and only wind could pass through the cloth. For insect pollination, plants remained uncovered, allowing free access to insects to pollinate the flowers. At fruit maturity, when fruits were completely red, fruits from each treatment were harvested on the same date and under the same conditions. Results illustrated the substantial importance of insects as pollinators of tomato crops. Open field had greater tomato yield and positive effects on physicochemical properties on fruit than under self and wind pollination.},

  abstract = {African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were investigated for physiological stress parameters to assess the influence of different cultivation techniques on fish welfare. The fish were reared in two conceptually identical recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) constructed in a greenhouse. One system was combined with a floating raft hydroponic unit to culture cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) only using the process water. The second system remained without the plant cultivation unit and functioned as the control. Water quality was monitored regularly by measuring dissolved nutrients and physical water parameters. During 87 days, a total of 71 fish from each system (n = 142) were studied, with a final sampling of all fish (n = 107) at the end of the experiment. Blood from the caudal vein was analyzed for the stress hormone cortisol and the glucose concentration. In addition, fish were investigated for external injuries on their skin, fins and barbels. The results demonstrate that the system design had no influence on fish mortalities and growth rates. Furthermore, cortisol and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two systems. However, the number of external injuries was significantly lower in the aquaponics, providing evidence that co-cultivation of fish and plants might offer benefits to the welfare of the fish.},

  abstract = {The IWA Anaerobic Digestion Modelling Task Group was established in 1997 at the 8th World Congress on Anaerobic Digestion (Sendai, Japan) with the goal of developing a generalised anaerobic digestion model. The structured model includes multiple steps describing biochemical as well as physicochemical processes. The biochemical steps include disintegration from homogeneous particulates to carbohydrates, proteins and lipids; extracellular hydrolysis of these particulate substrates to sugars, amino acids, and long chain fatty acids (LCFA), respectively; acidogenesis from sugars and amino acids to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and hydrogen; acetogenesis of LCFA and VFAs to acetate; and separate methanogenesis steps from acetate and hydrogen/CO2. The physico-chemical equations describe ion association and dissociation, and gas-liquid transfer. Implemented as a differential and algebraic equation (DAE) set, there are 26 dynamic state concentration variables, and 8 implicit algebraic variables per reactor vessel or element. Implemented as differential equations (DE) only, there are 32 dynamic concentration state variables.},

  abstract = {Pressure on agricultural land from a rising global population is necessitating the maximisation of food production per unit area of cultivation. Attention is increasingly turning to Vertical Farming (VF) approaches in an attempt to provide a greater crop yield per square meter of land. However, this term has been used to cover a broad range of approaches, from personal- or community-scale vegetable and herb growing to vast skyscrapers for commercial production of a wide range of crops. This article summarises the main categories of VF in order to help clarify this emerging but sometimes confusing area of agriculture and discusses how scientific investigation of the potential of VF is currently lacking and will be required to help determine its feasibility as a method to assist meaningfully in global food production.},

The microbiological and physical - chemical monitoring of the system was carried for 42 days, and water from the fish tank was analyzed every 15 days, in the decanter, in the sump tank and in the cultivation bed. The microbiological analyzes consisted in total and thermotolerant coliforms and heterotrophic mesophilic count. For physical – chemical parameters, we analyzed pH, Dissolved oxygen (DO), Toxic Ammonia and Nitrite. Additionally, the development of lettuce in the three different civil construction residues was determined by the average total weight, average leaf mass and average root mass of the plants. We concluded that there was total and thermotolerant coliforms in all the stages of the collection. There was a better growth of the lettuce in the substrate of broken brick, followed by expanded clay and finally by crushed stone.},

Most studies, implemented aquaponics on a large-scale for community food gardens. It is very few one focus on small/ home-sized system and its potential to local urban households with low-cost food. No specific paper present on the more benefits of using cycled and reusable and local materials to keep the aquaponics lasting and expanding to social life. The purpose of this paper wants to analyze the cost and benefits of applied aquaponic systems ultimately using the recycled and reusable materials as well as local materials and mobile apply in the small area to pursue the goals: saving the areas and water resources, investigating costs and providing clean and safe food to urban household/consumers. The model is also a green, clean and friendly to environment. The applied aquaponics is the great sustainable agriculture not only more adapting to climate change, friendlier to environment but also the best systems to applied in high land area, island, and especially in the urban city where the population is increasingly every single day. It is more convenient to set up or transfer to different location with low cost and easier to management. Furthermore, it is excellent sustainable and efficient model when climate changing: saving water resources and reducing waste to pollute environment more efficiently. The model gives a chance to people living in the suburban area with less land to produce the fresh and safe food for their own requirements as well as supply safe food to consumers. It is also a little garden to increase the green area to tolerance the polluted air in the city/urban area.},

  abstract = {This study was carried out to investigate the viability of utilizing aquaponic technology in culturing local fish: snakehead Channa striata and water spinach Ipomoea aquatica. Snakehead was raised for 150 days in a floating plastic pond with an area of 3 × 4 × 1.2 m having a capacity volume of ∼14.4 m3. Fish were randomly arranged into two experimental systems at density of ∼0.3 kg fingerlings/m3 e.g. SAQ – snakehead in aquaponics; SC –snakehead in normal system where control ponds were continuously aerated with ∼20\% daily exchange of water. Fish were fed commercial feed twice a day. Initial results showed that in aquaponics compared with normal systems the SAQ efficiency exhibited 70\% water exchange; five times lower in NH3 level: (0.01–0.03 mg/ L vs. 0.05–0.16 mg/L); three times lower in NO2 level: (0.28–0.58 mg/L vs. 0.56–2.59 mg/L). Snakehead production was significantly higher in aquaponics with higher survival ratio of fish: 99.76\% vs. 71.40\%; ∼3 times higher in fish yield: 366 kg vs. 130 kg. The production of water spinach was also elevated in aquaponics versus normal systems 406.4 kg vs. 188 kg. The total income from snakehead and water spinach in SAQ were 4 times higher than in normal farming systems: 1219.42 \$US and 307.04 \$US. Based on the results of the current study, it is expected that applying aquaponics utilizing local available materials and species will enhance the sustainability of the overall system and keep the aquaponics lasting and expanding to social life especially on sustainable culturing snakehead Channa striata.},

Both require us to embrace self-organizing properties, whether in nature or society. The author critically appraises backcasting as a methodology for visioning, arguing that backcasting’s potential for radical, outside-the-box thinking is restricted unless it contemplates a break with class society, connects with existing grassroots struggles (notably over land) and dialogues with the utopian socialist tradition. The article develops a case study of food, starting from the physical parameters of combating the entropy expressed in the loss of soil structure, and applies this to urban food-growing. Drawing upon ‘real utopias’ of existing practice, the author proposes a threefold categorization – subsistence plots, an urban forest, and an ultra-high productivity sector – and emphasizes the emergent properties of such a complex system characterized by the ‘free energy’ of societal self-organization.},

Nine experimental units (three replications per treatment) were utilised. A total of 123 rainbow trout (initial body weight: 142 ± 35 g) were randomly distributed in six 500-L tanks (3 per stocking density) and monitored during a 117 day trial period. The final weight (331 g on average), specific growth rate (0.73\% d−1), feed conversion ratio (1.58), and mortality (3\%) of the fish did not differ between stocking densities. The morphometric indices, slaughter results, and flesh quality were not affected. Similarly, the quantity of lettuce produced during two consecutive cycles was similar among treatments (2.4 kg m−2 on average). At harvest, microbial contamination (total viable count, E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, mould, and yeasts) was similar in the fish skin and lettuce produced in aquaponic systems with different stocking densities, as well as in the lettuce produced in aquaponic and hydroponic systems. In conclusion, rainbow trout and lettuce productions were successful in the tested aquaponic system, whereas stocking density did not affect fish growth or flesh quality.},

Our data shows that the nutrient concentrations supplied by the fish in aquaponic system are significantly lower for most nutrients, compared to hydroponic systems. Nevertheless, plants do thrive in solutions that have lower nutrient levels than “standard” hydroponic solutions. This is especially true for green leafy vegetables that rarely need additional nutritional supplementation. It is concluded that in the highly complex system of aquaponics, special care has to be taken, via continuous monitoring of the chemical composition of the circulating water, to provide adequate concentrations and ratios of nutrients, and special attention has to be paid to the potentially toxic component, ammonium. If certain plants require nutrient supplementation, we consider that one based on organic substances would be most beneficial. However, protocols for the application of such nutrient amendments still need to be developed.},

Numerous studies have been published about aquaculture, introducing a variety of techniques and methods that have been applied or could be applied in aquaculture production systems. The purpose of this study is to present a systemic overview of the functions of aquaculture production systems. Each function of an aquaculture system is applied to carry out a certain purpose. The results are divided into three sets of functions: input, treatment, and output. Input functions deal with what happens before the rearing area, treatment functions are about what happens inside the rearing area, and output functions is what comes out of the system. In this study, five input functions, ten treatment functions, and five output functions are indentified. For each function the controlling parameters or indicators were identified and then a list of possible methods or technological solutions in order to carry out the function was compiled. The results are presented in a system map that aggregates all functions used in different types of aquaculture systems along with their methods of solution. This is the first of four articles that together generate taxonomy of both means and ends in aquaculture. The aim is to identify both the technical solutions (means) that solve different functions (ends) and the corresponding functions. This article is about the functions.},

Aquaponic systems are known to be deficient in several plant-essential elements, which can be affected by solution pH to either increase or decrease available nutrients. To determine the effect of pH in a decoupled aquaponic system, a study was conducted using aquaculture effluent from tilapia culture tanks at four pH treatments: 5.0, 5.8, 6.5, and 7.0, used to irrigate a cucumber crop. Growth and yield parameters, nutrient content of the irrigation water, and nutrients incorporated into the plant tissue were collected over two growing seasons. pH did not have a practical effect on growth rate, internode length or yield over the two growing seasons. Availability and uptake of several nutrients were affected by pH, but there was no overarching effect that would necessitate its use in commercial systems. Nutrient concentrations in the aquaculture effluent would be considered low compared to hydroponic solutions; however, elemental analysis of leaf tissues was within the recommended ranges. Research into other nutrient sources provided by the system (i.e., solid particles carried with the irrigation water) would provide further information into the nutrient dynamics of this system.},

The goal of this research was to assess the feasibility of implementing a small scale (4542-L) home-based aquaponic system in a small (48.768 m2) greenhouse to produce fresh produce and fish protein. System construction and maintenance costs were compared to the value of crops and fish produced to determine whether this aquaponic system is a feasible option for the home grower. It was hypothesized that this system would break even in five years. Results showed that such a system can be successfully built and operated to yield fresh produce, fish protein, and a high value composted fertilizer on an annual basis. However, the payback period for the system can be five years or even longer, depending on the estimation of future costs and benefits and discount rates used. Results and experience from the greenhouse system have been and will continue to be used for system improvements, education on natural systems, designs for others, as well as a guide for aquaponic systems moving forward.},

Aquaponics productions (54 plants/production) had ponds effluents as a nutritional support from the breeding of pikeperch, tanks were arranged with 255 numbers of pikeperch, each tank of 85 individuals, with a total of fish biomass of 30.76 kg. Fish individual body weight in the experiment was between 66 and 238 grams with an average of 120. 69 g. Chemical analyses were carried out to determine the level of nitrates in 5 plants grown in aquaponic system and respectively, conventional technology. The results have shown that the nitrate level is higher in the salad obtained from the aquaponic system than in conventional technology, however not exceeding the maximum permitted limits.},

Aquaponics is essentially the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, and it fits very well in the therm „sustainable production technolgy” The aim of this study was to assess the quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) production obtained in an integrated aquaponic system with recirculating aquaculture system of pikeperch growing. The fish was breaded in recirculating system. The plants were cultivated in the aquaponic module. Fish species used was represented by pikeperch (Sander lucioperca). Biological plant material used in the experiments was represented by lettuce, Lactuca sativa, variety White Boston. Chemical analyses concerning phosphorus level in plants were carried out over a number of 5 plants in Repetition 1, 5 plants in Repetition 2 and 5 plants in Control Version. Phosphorus was determined in the form of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5). Determination of phosphorus was made by dosage in 2\% acetic acid from plant material, followed by colorimetric determination of phosphorus. The differences between P2O5 levels from the salad aquaponically produced and P2O5 levels in salad conventionally produced in natural conditions are statistically significant (p{$<$}0.001). P2O5 levels from the salad aquaponically produced are higher.},

While the practice has been growing in popularity, relatively little mathematical models exist which aim to study the system processes. In this paper, we present a system of ODEs which aims to mathematically model the population and concetrations dynamics present in an aquaponic environment. Values of the parameters in the system are estimated from the literature so that simulated results can be presented to illustrate the nature of the solutions to the system. As well, a brief sensitivity analysis is performed in order to identify redundant parameters and highlight those which may need more reliable estimates. Specifically, an inverse problem with manufactured data for fish and plants is presented to demonstrate the ability of the collage theorem to recover parameter estimates.},

In this study, we investigate the newly isolated seawater strain, Synechococcus, native to the United Arab Emirates, and evaluate its value as a perspective organism for cultivation (for fuel and bio-products) in regions with freshwater scarcity. The strain displayed tolerance to a wide range of temperature (22–37 ◦C) and salinity (20–41 ppt), with maximum biomass concentration of 0.72 g L−1 and a maximum growth rate of 82 mg L−1 d−1 at 25 ◦C and 33 ppt salinity. Lipids accumulation reached up to 26\% of dry weight in nitrogen-depleted conditions (with 1.8 mM of nitrates addition to the media), whereas protein content exceeded 50\% dry weight. In this study, harvesting is investigated using three chemical agents: Ferric chloride, sodium hydroxide, and chitosan. Cell disruption is analyzed for four distinct treatments: Enzymatic, alkaline, ultrasonic, and hydrothermal. Among tested methods, flocculation with sodium hydroxide and ultrasonication were found to be the most efficient techniques for harvesting and cell disruption, respectively. The growth characteristics of the local strain and the potential to derive protein and lipids from it makes it a promising biomass in a biorefinery context.},

  abstract = {The ongoing global push for sustainable food production has motivated both the greenhouse horticulture and aquaculture sectors to explore the potential of geothermal energy for heating as an alternative to fossil fuels. Greenhouses and fish farms experience distinct heat demand fluctuations throughout the year and therefore do not make consistent use of geothermal wells. Geothermal wells on the other hand, need to operate close to full capacity year-round to be profitable. An opportunity to improve the economic feasibility of geothermal heating infrastructure is to use circular food production systems, such as aquaponics, which can be operated as a thermal treatment network in order to increase heat extraction from geothermal well installations. The EU funded GEOFOOD project aims to analyze in detail how to optimise the design and operation of geothermal aquaponic facilities. To quantify the potential benefits, a predictive model was developed which simulates the heat balances present throughout the aquaponic-based thermal treatment network. The inputs include the relevant climate parameters of the location, the type of greenhouse/building for both facilities including climate control equipment, as well as crop and fish species. For a scenario considering a 5-ha Dutch tomato greenhouse it is found that geothermal heat extraction can be increased with 31\% by combining it with an indoor pike-perch fish farm of 6544 m2, without the need of alternative energy sources during peak demands.},

A total of 104 largemouth bass (initial body weight: 236 ± 38 g) were randomly stocked in eight 500 L tanks (four per stocking density) and monitored during a 70-day period. Vegetables yield was similar in LD and MD groups. Lettuce yield (6.33 kg m-2) was in line with typical values, whereas radicchio showed a negligible yield (1.34 kg m-2). Likewise, fish final weight (263 g, on average), specific growth rate (0.17\% d-1), feed conversion ratio (2.72), and mortality (4.8\%) did not differ between treatments. Fish morphometric indices, slaughter results and fillet quality were not affected by stocking density. In conclusion, the production of lettuce was successful in the tested system, whereas the production of radicchio did not achieve satisfactory results. Growth performances of the largemouth bass were poor and further investigations are required to optimize the rearing of this fish species in low-tech aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {Sustainable food production and sustainable diets along the food chain continue to be key challenges in the 21st century mainly due to population growth and urbanization. These also offer opportunities for new sustainable food production technologies. Aquaponics - an integrated closed-loop multi-trophic food production system that combines elements of a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) and hydroponics is one of the approaches. But knowledge and understanding of these kind of new technologies is required at an early age. In other words, aquaponics could be turned into education for sustainability. There is potential for applying aquaponics on a wide spectrum of academic disciplines with a possibility for practical incorporation into existing educational curriculum. Literature about the use of aquaponics in education is currently inadequate and therefore this paper sought to identify possibilities and obstacles on how aquaponics can be affectively utilized in teaching primary school children. Data from three (N=3) independent qualitative interviews from: a biology teacher, a consultant entrepreneur and aquaponics expert, and one local aquaponics bio-farmer were obtained. The data analysis procedure was inspired by Future Workshop approach, leading to categorization and evaluation of statements from participants in three categories: Critique, Fantasy and Strategy. Some of the positive issues from informants’ perspectives included: a wide range of application in the subjects: biology, mathematics, science and more. Reduced pollution and efficient resource usage, flexibility of the system set up such as on rooftops, and production of organic-like twofold produce - fish and plant foods. Potential limitations included: time constraints, lack of financial resources as well as the need for frequent care and maintenance. The findings showed that visions of a new way of teaching with inclusion of the modern technology could be perceived as an advantage in influencing transformational processes at Danish schools. Nevertheless, this process requires some criticalconsiderations both practical and theoretical for implementation of the system in order to make it successful and sustainable in the long-term.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics, producing fish and vegetables in a closed-loop water system, reduces fertilizer use and water discharge, and is therefore promoted as a sustainable venture. A recent global study found that the majority of 257 surveyed aquaponics farms made losses, but the reasons have been poorly analyzed. Based upon grey literature and a post-hoc cost-benefit analysis for an investment in an aquaponics farm in the Philippines, this paper aims to assess the factors contributing to an appropriate level of returns. In the Philippines, vegetables are relatively well-priced, but if catfish were produced, a venture producing 1250 kg fish, 6000 kg lettuce, and 300 kg tomato per year would have a Net-Benefit-Cost Ratio of below 1.3 after 20 years. This ratio should be higher when one considers the risks against which a farmer cannot and should not insure its production, as argued in the paper. Depending on the species of both fish and vegetables, the quantity of nutrients coming from the former component imposes a fish volume: vegetable area ratio ranging from 1:30 to 1:100, thus the quantity of marketable fresh vegetables determines the size of an aquaponics enterprise. As a consequence, the investments in the fish component are relatively high and weigh heavily on the financial balance. For producers to successfully adopt aquaponics, they need to consider starting first with catfish, and then, as they get to master the system’s management, they can shift to a high-value fish species for niche markets.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture development over the past 50 years has been facilitated largely by the application of science and the introduction of new technologies. Although aquaculture is a very diverse sector in products, production systems and business structures, almost every activity has benefited from scientific advances. However, the impact of technological progress is most clearly seen where there has also been substantial industrial consolidation. This has provided greater capital resources for investment and a more attractive market for suppliers of innovations to target. It has also encouraged consolidation of research capacity and stronger articulation between private and publicly funded research efforts. Further development along current trajectories is possible through advances in genomics, information technology, materials science and other areas. However, there may also be substantial disruptions if, for instance, energy becomes much more expensive, or large mono-cultures are impacted by climate change. Substantial change could also be driven by policies that aim at bringing realistic external costs of environmental services into company accounts. Research into more resilient aquaculture systems that comply more with ecological than financial accounting principles is under way, but will require substantial development to meet the challenges of rising food needs and social aspirations.},

  abstract = {The development of marine intensive land-based aquaculture systems has been limited due to the absence of methods to manage saline wastewater. Aquaponic systems, although commonly applied to freshwater aquaculture, can potentially manage nutrient wastes while providing a secondary product. The aim of this study was to evaluate both the capacity for water treatment and the production requirements of two saltwater-tolerant plant species (Sesuvium portulacastrum and Batis maritima) when grown hydroponically in a marine aquaponic system. The presence of plants was found to significantly contribute to nitrate removal, such that mean nitrate concentrations were 10.1 Æ 5.4 and 12.1 Æ 6.1 mg/L NO3À-N in planted and unplanted treatments respectively. The use of coconut fibre as a planting medium also significantly contributed to nitrate removal, such that mean nitrate concentrations were 9.78 Æ 5.4 and 12.4 Æ 6.0 mg/L NO3À-N in coconut fibre and expanded clay treatments respectively. Daily nitrogen removal was greatest in the coconut fibre/ plants treatment, ranging from À18\% to 67\%. Hydraulic loading rate, plant species and plant density did not significantly affect water quality or plant growth. The low flow/saltwort/low density treatment had the greatest mean daily nitrogen removal, ranging from 25\% to 172\%. The results indicate that the main nitrogen removal mechanisms were simultaneous nitrification–denitrification in the hydroponic plant beds and nitrogen removal through plant growth. This study demonstrates that marine aquaponics could be an effective way to manage nutrient removal in marine land-based aquaculture systems.},

  abstract = {The need to expand marine fish production and improve the economic viability and sustainability of recirculating aquaculture systems led to the development of a zero-discharge, marine aquaponic system. In this study, water treatment capacity, nutrient cycling, and biomass production were evaluated in a prototype, commercial-scale marine aquaponic system that included a moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) for nitrification, a sand filter for solids removal and denitrification, and hydroponic plant beds. Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), two species of edible halophytes sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum) and saltwort (Batis maritima), and organic solids, were successfully produced over a 9-month period. Extensive analysis of solids, organic matter, and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) in water and plant biomass was used to develop detailed mass balances on the system. Simultaneous operation of the moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) and plant beds resulted in high ammonia removal rates, allowing the system to support a high fish biomass density (38.8 kg/m3). Passive denitrification was the main nitrate removal mechanism, contributing to approximately 59\% of aqueous nitrogen removal. Conversion of a sand filter to a side-stream denitrification reactor resulted in removal of 17\% of the daily aqueous nitrogen load and prevented nitrate accumulation in the system. In addition to fish and edible halophyte production, 34 kg of organic solids were harvested from the sand filter and provided to a commercial nursery that used the solids as a fertilizer. This study demonstrates that marine aquaponics is an effective way to simultaneously produce marine fish, edible halophytes, and fertilizer. Addition of biological MBBR and a denitrifying sand filter was shown to be beneficial in situations where there are space limitations for plant growth, unexpected plant losses, or to support high densities of fish.},

  abstract = {This research presents the barriers and incentives faced by small-scale farmers in engaging in aquaponics systems in the São Carlos, Brazil community. Aquaponics is an agricultural system that combines hydroponics and aquaculture in a symbiotic arrangement to produce vegetables and protein simultaneously. Current research argues that aquaponics can help promote food security, community resiliency, and sustainable agriculture by integrating these versatile and necessarily organic systems into the urban environment. Despite historical use of aquaponics, there is currently a lack of research focused on the social dimensions of this emerging sustainable technology, including an assessment of barriers that may exist for local farmers to engage in aquaponics systems. During May 2018, 21 interviews were conducted with the owners of small farms (in Portuguese, "agriculturas familiares") within 30 kilometers of São Carlos, Brazil. The interviews revealed that there is interest in the potential profitability of aquaponics systems and an existing knowledge base of organics, hydroponics, and agriculture in the community. However, lack of initial financing and time to build the systems were also significant barriers to creating the systems. Cities could reduce this barrier through contracting with local farmers to increase farmer financial stability and reduce perceived risks. Knowledgesharing workshops should also reduce technical barriers to engagement. These recommendations can be used to address these barriers in São Carlos and could be applied to cities throughout the world as they seek to promote the use of aquaponics and advance their local food security.},

The effect of different treatment technologies on the nitrogen fertilisation effects of fish sludge was studied by a bioassay with barley (Hordeum vulgare), an incubation and a field experiment. Dried fish sludge resulted in relative agronomic efficiency of 50–80\% compared with mineral fertiliser. The anaerobic digestate based on fish sludge (20 vol\%) and dairy manure did not increase nitrogen uptake in barley. Increasing the ratio of fish sludge in the digestate increased the fertilisation effect, but requires optimisation of the biogas process. A simple logistics analysis conducted for a case hatchery showed that on-site drying and co-digestion of fish sludge in a central biogas plant can be regarded as equal in terms of costs. Norway can become an exporter of fish sludge-based recycling fertilisers if current regulations are modified to facilitate nutrient recycling.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze current practices in commercial urban rooftop farming (URF). In recent years, URF has been experiencing increasing popularity. It is a practice that is well-suited to enhancing food security in cities and reducing the environmental impact that results from long transportation distances that are common in conventional agriculture. To date, most URF initiatives have been motivated by social and educational factors rather than the aim of creating large sustainable food production systems in cities. The commercial operation of urban rooftop farms, should they become profitable, is likely to attract notable private investment, allowing a significant level of high quality urban food production to be achieved. There is a reasonable amount of literature available on urban farming that deals with its potential, and its limitations. However, it does not focus on commercial operations. In contrast to other surveys and theoretical papers, this study of URF focuses on large and commercial operations. The analysis showed that commercial URFs can be grouped into two main types: Firstly, hydroponic systems in greenhouses where mostly leafy greens, tomatoes, and herbs are grown; secondly, soil-based open-air farms that grow a large variety of vegetables. Hydroponics is frequently seen as the key technology for commercial urban food production. While the technology is not in and of itself sustainable, hydroponic farms often make an effort to implement environmentally friendly technologies and methods. However, there is still untapped potential to systemically integrate farms into buildings. The findings of this study identified where future research is needed in order to make URF a widespread sustainable solution.},

  abstract = {In the agriculture sector, the efficient management of fertilizers is reflected into a saving of money and time. Many software developments are found in the scientific literature and in the market that optimize the performance and use of fertilizers for specific crops. Most of them do not take into account the current price of fertilizers; and others show a high computational cost, which means high time to solve scenarios with medium–high number of fertilizers to select and high power consumption, being not suitable for mobile devices. In this work Ecofert is presented as a simple and powerful software application developed for Android O.S. that calculates the best combination of fertilizers to obtain the desired nutrient solution for different crops, taking into account the current price of fertilizers in the market. The main novelties of Ecofert is, on the one hand, that it solves the fertilization selection by modeling this as a Linear Programming problem, and using specific mathematical libraries to solve it. On the other hand, Ecofert works with a list of commercial fertilizers hosted in a Data Base in the Cloud, where the composition and price (in Euro) is updated daily. Moreover Ecofert shows a low computational cost, even for large number of fertilizers ({$>$}20). Its simplicity permits Ecofert to be executed in mobile devices, giving farmers and agriculture technicians a powerful tool to support agricultural tasks in situ.},

  abstract = {The operation of so-called Zero Emission Buildings (ZEB) does not result in harmful emissions to water, soil and air. In contrast, ZEBs produce energy, water and resources. Therefore, the definition of ZEBs in this paper goes well beyond the definition of (Net) Zero Energy Buildings, which focuses primarily on greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. The concept of ZEB is based on the decentralization of urban infrastructure systems on the building level. The aim is to avoid environmental impacts during the building operation through sustainable production, management, consumption, and recycling of resources. In order to facilitate an easy evaluation of ZEBs a ZEB assessment tool needed to be developed. This paper discusses the development of the general framework, the assessment method, and the ZEB Assessment Tool (ZEBAT), which facilitates the evaluation of the environmental performance of potential ZEBs. The exemplary evaluation of selected case studies from Switzerland and South Korea illustrates the method and the practicability of the ZEBAT for the evaluation of potential ZEBs. The holistic integration of environmental performance factors and their specific environmental impacts facilitates the successful application of the ZEBAT independently from the specific use of a building and its geographical location.},

  abstract = {Salt-tolerant plants can be used as biofilters for nutrient-rich saline water such as aquaculture process water. Tripolium pannonicum (Jacq.) Dobrocz. was used to determine optimal culturing conditions for an efficient biofilter performance in terms of nutrient recycling by plant uptake. This performance was evaluated by taking different parameters into account, such as biomass production, plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake as well as physiological parameters and decrease of nitrate-N and phosphate-P concentrations in the experimental fluid. Afterwards, additional plant species known as edible were studied to follow the idea of generating valuable co-products beside the use as biofilter. It was shown that a nitrate-N concentration of at least 10mgl-1is necessary for reasonable biomass production. A phosphate-P concentration of 0.3mgl-1is sufficient, but higher concentrations promote the uptake of phosphate-P. The addition of iron in chelated form is required for the growth of healthy plant biomass; the addition of manganese is beneficial but not implicitly necessary. Salt concentrations lower than seawater salinity promote biomass production and nutrient uptake. The use of a hydroponic culture system is more suitable than sand or expanded clay culture if controlled conditions and nutrient recycling are desired. The five weeks experiment to compare different halophyte species in 0.24m2tanks with nine plants each resulted in above ground fresh weight of 185 to 398g and total uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus of 0.6 to 2.1g and 0.1 to 0.4g, respectively. All tested species have potential to serve as biofilter and source for valuable co-products. A promising application is the growth of halophytic vegetable plants in marine aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {In the Western part of Europe aquaculture is represented by intensive and semi-intensive systems with mostly marine fish species, while in the Eastern countries traditional aquaculture is extensive, in ponds, with primarily freshwater fish species. Extensive aquaculture utilizes large amounts of freshwater and decomposition of wasted feed and fish excreta can lead to eutrophication in receiving waters. Alternative intensive aquaculture systems with recirculation are being developed in order to improve rational water use and lower the environmental impact. The objective of this study was to reduce the water pollution in small-scale cyprinid fish farms with a diversion of recirculation water into aquaponic system. The experiment ran in two 36 m3 fishponds, one as experimental and one as control pond with the starting fish load of 0.6 kg/m3 of carp (Cyprinus c. carpio L.) per pond. Ultrasound device for inhibition of algae growth was installed in the experimental pond. From there the water was pumped by a bypass to the treatment train consisting of a lamellar settler, a roughing filter and a vertical constructed wetland planted with tomatoes (Lycopersicum esculentum L.). The pilot fish farm was monitored from June to September 2011 for physical and chemical parameters, chlorophyll-a concentration and fish body weight increase. The aquaponic system was efficient in the removal of TSS, BOD5, COD, NH4-N and TP but not in the removal of NO3-N, NO2-N. The ultrasound successfully inhibited algae growth in experimental pond. A higher fish production was achieved compared to the control pond due to better rearing conditions. The closed-loop system presented could be useful for semi-natural fish farming.},

  abstract = {This study examined the establishment and growth performance of 34 food crops grown in a cool, low nutrient aquaponic system. Process water from a spring-fed flow-through trout raceway, with an average fish biomass of 3630 kg, was used as the water and nutrient source for the plant growing operation. Process water temperature entering the plant growing channels was 13 °C with average concentrations of 0.35, 0.34 and 0.19 mg·L-1 for ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate, respectively. Crop types included lettuce, Asian greens, mustards, other greens, vegetables and herbs. Stand establishment (percent filled cells) and harvest and individual biomass were evaluated under three treatments; low flow (18.9 L/min), high flow (75.7 L/min), and an amended high flow treatment. The amended high flow treatment consisted of vermiculite planting media amended with composted fish waste and was placed in a channel receiving high flow. These treatments represented a gradient of nutrient availability with low flow receiving the fewest and the amended high flow treatment receiving the most nutrients. Due to space constraints cultivars were sown in two sets. Cultivars in set two were sown as space was made available when cultivars from set one were harvested. Stand establishment was greater than 80\% for most cultivars under all treatments. However, the herbs sage, garlic chives, and lovage had poor stand establishment as did the vegetables Swiss chard and beets, which were sown late in the study. For most cultivars, stand establishment was not significantly different among treatments. The majority of cultivars attained the lowest biomass on the low flow treatment. Notable exceptions were cilantro, parsley, and minutina. Eight cultivars, including kohlrabi and the bibb lettuce 'Rex', grew best on the high flow treatment. The remaining 21 cultivars realized the greatest biomass on the amended treatment although in many cases the increase in biomass was minor. Additionally, for some cultivars, significant increases in stand establishment offset decreases in growth. Minimal improvements in water quality were observed, probably as a result of nutrient mobilization from accumulated solids within the aquaponic channels. Statement of relevance: Many producers want to produce aquaponic crops but little basic information such as provided in this study is available about stand establishment, expected harvest biomass, or time to harvest making this study extremely relevant to commercial aquaculture.},

We describe a method where the plant component was isolated from the fish rearing operation so that nutrient removal could be evaluated independently. Two crops, lettuce (Latuca sativa) and nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus), were evaluated. Nasturtium had higher removal rates and removed both total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrate resulting in 80\% DIN removal while lettuce removed only 48\%. Lettuce removed only TAN and was ineffective at nitrate removal. Older plants were more effective at DIN removal while younger plants were more effective at PO4removal. When normalized for biomass, younger plants had much higher removal rates. These results demonstrated that both crop and cropping method have considerable impacts on nutrient removal. This method will allow operators to adjust their system quickly and easily to meet remediation goals.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a food production system which connects recirculating aquaculture (fish) to hydroponics (plants) systems. Although aquaponics has the potential to improve soil conditions by reducing erosion and nutrient loss and has been shown to reduce food production related carbon emissions by up to 73\%, few commercial aquaponics projects in the EU and UK have been successful. Key barriers to commercial success are insufficient initial investment, an uncertain and complex regulatory environment, and the lack of projects operating on a large scale able to demonstrate profitability. In this paper, we use the UK as a case study to discuss the legal and economic barriers to the success of commercial aquaponics in the EU. We also propose three policies: (1) making aquaponics eligible for the new system of Environmental Land Management grants; (2) making aquaponics eligible for organic certification; and (3) clarifying and streamlining the aquaponics licence application process. The UK’s departure from the EU presents a unique opportunity to review agricultural regulations and subsidies, which in turn could provide evidence that similar reforms are needed in the EU.},

  abstract = {The larva of the non-biting mosquito, Chironomus sp., feeds on roots of horticultural plants and can damage indoor horticultural crops, particularly lettuce, Lactuca sativa L., and young tomatoes, Solanum lycopersicum L. (Cranston 1987). Small swarms occur near deposits of water from filtration systems. The fungus gnat, Bradysia sp., is a nuisance of several greenhouse-grown plants (Howard et al. 1994). Harris et al. (1996) mentioned that larvae feed on roots and indirectly transmit disease (Gillespie and Menzies 1993). Fungus gnat adults are a nuisance to greenhouse operators, interiorscapers, and consumers and can be monitored with yellow sticky cards (Drees http://hortipm.tamu.edu/publications/Fgnats.html). We tested three colors of sticky traps to monitor Chironomus sp. and Bradysia sp. within an aquaponic system. Aquaponic systems use large tanks to cultivate fish where the water is filtered and allowed to gravity feed to the hydroponic component (raceways or growbeds), carrying constant nutrients to the plants that are floating on polystyrene rafts. The water is pumped back to the fish, restarting the cycle. In aquaponic-production systems, the benefits of soilless hydroponic plant production are retained in addition to production of fish. It is within the filtration and cracks between the plant rafts where small swarms of these insects congregate. Two identical aquaponic systems were used within a glass greenhouse at the Texas A\&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center at Weslaco, TX. Each re-circulating aquaponic system was 5,680-liters. They were composed of two 1,135-liter fish tanks, a series of filtration tanks, and two 1.2-m wide x 7.3-m long aerated hydroponic raceways. The fish tanks retained water for 60 minutes, with the hydroponic raceways retaining water for approximately 48 minutes. Chironomus sp. and Bradysia sp. adults were detected by randomly placing three cards, green, blue, and yellow sticky cards (15 x 10 cm; AlphaScents, Portland, OR) on each raceway (four replications total) and over filtration tanks (two replications total). Sticky traps were monitored for 2 weeks on six growth stages of one cultivar of romaine (Lactuca sativa, 'Dragoon'). Statistical analysis (PROCMIXED with repeated measurements, means separated by LSMeans, and data square-root transformed, SAS Institute 2009) showed numbers of Chironomus sp. and Bradysia sp. adults not significantly different among the traps on the raceways and filtration systems (Table 1). The non-significant results were caused by much variation. Three to four times more Bradysia sp. adults were caught on blue than other colors of traps on the raceways in both weeks. Chironomus sp. was caught twice as often on blue traps during the first week and slightly more than on other colors during the second week. Bradysia sp. was caught in the filtration system approximately twice as often on blue traps Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Southwestern-Entomologist on 2/2/2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by Fundacao Getulio Vargas SP},

The objective was to determine the envi­ ronmental impact of the whole process using life cycle assessment (LCA) in order to design a strategy for a sustainable management of the crops. The studied system includes aquaponics (integrated raising of Oreochromis niloticus (tilapia) and Lactuca sativa (lettuce) is considered), a monitoring system (drone), and telemetrics (data processing system). The functional unit was: 1 monitoring unit for aquaponics. The inventory was built from information provided by the enterprise owner of the system and official electricity and water data. The assess­ ment was performed using the software openLCA v.1.10.3, the method CML baseline v.4.4.4, and the databases ELCD v.3.2 and Agribalyse v3.0.1. Based on the results of the LCA, a management strategy was proposed to reduce the environmental load, which is mainly due to nutrient recirculation, water pumping, and the number of drone flights. It was concluded that improving the three factors a reduction of 10 \%, 10 \%, and 60 \% on average, respectively, can be achieved.},

  abstract = {History proves that food security is closely related to social security, economic stability, political stability and national security or security. Therefore, one of Goal the National Medium Term Development Plans (RPJMN) for 2015-2019 is to realize economic independence by moving the strategic sectors of the domestic economy through increasing sovereignty / food security. Food security is closely related to improve the quality of Indonesian human resources. We hold community service in the area of South Kembangan, which has 9 Rukun Warga, but only 7 Rukun Warga are active in each activity. The total population in Kembangan Selatan Village are 30,169 people, consisting of 3,219 toddlers aged 0-4 years, 3,774 children aged between 5-9 years, 2,849 children aged between 10-15 years, 3,457 teenagers aged between 15- 19 years, 13,640 people aged 20-44 years, 3,230 people aged over 50 years. We chose urban area as our community service, where the people live in a house where the land area is not wide enough to grow crops in contrast to rural areas where the land is still large enough to grow crops. Not surprisingly, urban food needs are mostly produced from rural areas. Then how can each household use the limited land effectively, especially those who live in urban areas? In recent years Aquaponics technology has been introduced primarily so that people can use their yards effectively. Aquaponics combines aquaculture and hydroponics systems "that is, by utilizing organic waste fish farming as a source of nutrition in crop cultivation. Aquaponics continuously uses water sourced from ponds where water is raised for plants and then returned to fish ponds so that this forms a circulation. For this activity we conducted several trainings for the PKK activator groups in the Kembangan Selatan Village. We hope that these PKK drivers can apply Aquaponics technology in their respective regions. Training and aquaponics tools were made at the Child Friendly Integrated Public Space (RPTRA) park in South Kembangan. Our training on a number of topics: 1. Healthy, Independent and Prosperous Families, 2. Family Financial Management, 3. Family Food Security, 4. Aquaponics Training. The training conducted was an aquaponics technology pilot project for Kembangan Selatan Village. The purpose of this activity is establishing Food and Economy for each Household in the Kembangan Selatan Village.},

  abstract = {Rising temperatures, increasing food demand and scarcity of water and land resources highlight the importance of promoting the sustainable expansion of agriculture to our urban environment, while preserving water resources. Treating urban wastewaters, such as greywater and hydroponic wastewater, may represent a strategic point for the implementation of urban farming, ensuring food security, reducing pressures on water resources and promoting climate change mitigation. The WETWALL design concept proposes a unique ecotechnology for secondary wastewater treatment at an urban scale, which brings the novelty of a modular living wall hybrid flow. This concept is based on the integration of two established nature-based solutions/ecomimetic designs: constructed wetlands and a modular living walls. First presented is an overview about the state of the art in the scope of living walls treating wastewater, in order to identify the main design aspects related to the performance of such systems, which mainly concerns the removal of nitrates and phosphates. Second, the WETWALL design concept is presented. A scheme regarding the selection of the main components, such as plants and substrate, is proposed, and potential structure developments and operation strategies are discussed. In addition, considering the scope of integrating the circular economy with the design process, potential interactions between this technology and the urban environment are discussed. The main goal of this article is to substantiate the potential of the WETWALL design concept as an innovative wastewater treatment at an urban scale.},

  abstract = {The implementation of aquaponics systems has significantly increased in the last two decades, and several studies have reported on the technical, socioeconomic, and environmental ramifications in order to achieve sustainability in food production. The present study, however, aimed to perform a commercial-scale economic evaluation, using a model marine aquaponics production system with the halophyte Sarcocornia ambigua and the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei cultivated in nutrient film technology (NFT) and biofloc technology (BFT) systems, respectively. To calculate phytotechnical and zootechnical indexes, we used recent studies available in the literature. Indicators of operational costs (total cost of production—TCP) and financial viability were calculated based on a cash flow horizon of 10 years. The proposed study estimated an initial investment of US\$ 474,253.07, with annual TCPs around US\$ 192,220.50, US\$ 247,740.52, and US\$ 223,482.65 years 1, 2 to 9, and 10, the different periods studied. Within these respective periods, the annual production of halophyte was 17,017, 23,286, and 18,808 kg, while marine shrimp production was 10,659, 14,586, and 11,781 kg. Based on these annual production numbers, the TCPs were US\$ 4.75, US\$ 4.03, and US\$ 4.67 kg−1 for halophyte and US\$ 10.45, US\$ 14.43, and US\$ 11.52 kg−1 for shrimp. Three sales prices were estimated per kilogram of halophyte produced and one fixed price per kilogram of shrimp produced. Only the highest selling price showed favorable indexes after testing sensitivities. Based on the above parameters, halophyte TCP was below sales value, i.e., reference price, with the possibility of increasing the price to “premium” level, indicating that this marine aquaponics production system was feasible for implementation in Brazil.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics has been considered as having great potential as an organic production method of aquatic organisms and vegetables, because the nutrient-rich water from aquatic organisms is utilized for plant growth. The essential elements of an aquaponic system consist of the following five: a tank to maintain aquatic organisms; a clarifier or sedimentation; a biofilter; a hydroponic component; and a sump pump. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of a nutrient film technique-type aquaponic system, which does not include the sump pump. Aquaponic systems were tested during one production cycle of the Carolina cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and Parris Island lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The aquatic organism employed was tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Nine systems were utilized with the aquaponic technique, and the remaining three were utilized with only the hydroponic technique as controls in plant production. The proposed aquaponic system worked efficiently during the entire crop cycle without any problems or deficiencies from lack sump. No changes were made in the flow of water in the aquaponic system during the growing season. Tilapia survival was 97.2 ± 2.4 \%. Specific growth and food conversion ratios were 4.95 and 0.99, respectively. In plant survival, there were no significant differences (p [ 0.05) between both production techniques. In lettuce, foliar wet weight, foliar dry weight, and yield were higher (p \textbackslash{} 0.05) in hydroponics. In cucumber, fruit number and yield were higher (p \textbackslash{} 0.05) in the hydroponic system. Fruit length, width, and weight exhibited no differences (p [ 0.05).},

As a result the tomato growers tried to find the best solutions for obtaining good quality and quantity yields. One solution is represented by the possibility of cultivating tomatoes in soilless culture, in polyethylene bags with a special soil mixture, composed mainly of peat and with controlled irrigation and fertilization. An experimental field was organized in 2006, as a poly-factorial experience with four experimental factors. The influence of all these factors upon early and total yield had been studied at the end of this research. Early yield had been registered until the end of May and it was of 1.64-2.63 kg/m2 for soil culture and 3.21-4.21 kg/m2 for polyethylene bag culture, on organic substratum. Total yield had been registered until the beginning of July and it was of 6.68-11 kg/m2 for soil culture and 11.16-13 kg/m2 for polyethylene bag culture. Differences up to 50 tons/ha at the total tomato yield were recorded between the two culture systems, the results underlining once more the superiority of the system of tomatoes grown on organic substratum, in polyethylene bags over the classic, conventional culture of tomatoes in the greenhouse soil.},

This study determined the effect of pH on phosphorus (P) speciation and availability in an aquaponics nutrient solution and used Visual MINTEQ to simulate P species and P activity. In both experimental and simulated results, P availability decreased with increase in pH of aquaponics nutrient solutions. According to simulations, P binds to several cations leaving less free phosphate ions available in solution. High pH values resulted in the formation of insoluble calcium phosphate species. The study also demonstrated the importance of organic matter and alkalinity in keeping free phosphate ions in solution at high pH ranges. It is recommended though that pH in aquaponics systems is maintained at a 5.5–7.2 range for optimal availability and uptake by plants.},

  abstract = {Plants grown in aquaponics frequently develop iron deficiency, which is generally corrected via supplementation with iron chelates. However, the solid waste excreted by fish contains considerable amounts iron, which are lost in the system by precipitation of insoluble iron oxides. Thus, the present study proposed the use of fulvic acid (FA), a humic substance with metal complexing capacity, to prevent iron precipitation and enhance its bioavailability in the aquaculture wastewater. An aquaponic solution was added with levels of fulvic acid (0, 69, 138, 345, and 690 mg L−1), and analyzed for dissolved iron after incubation and centrifugation. Visual MINTEQ was used to characterize and quantify the effect of fulvic acid levels on iron precipitation, species of possible solid forms, and concentration of dissolved bioavailable iron forms. Dissolved iron concentration increased with the inclusion of fulvic acid in the nutrient solution, and the highest iron concentration (22.4 μM) was obtained by treating the solution with 690 mg L−1 of fulvic acid. Visual MINTEQ simulations demonstrated that, in the absence of fulvic acid, iron precipitated in the form of αFe2O3, and the concentration of available iron increased with the inclusion of FA due to its complexing properties. Solution pH had no effect on iron availability with the absence of fulvic acid; in its presence, the effect of pH was only significant at values below 4.5. This study shows that fulvic acid seems to play an important role in transporting low-soluble iron from fish tanks to plant roots in aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {Plant growth promoters (PGP) are microorganisms essential for sustainable food production systems by improving the productivity of crops and mitigating environmental impacts. Microorganisms enhance the P availability to plants by mineralizing organic P and solubilizing precipitated phosphates. This work is focused on the effect of inoculation of a commercial product containing a mixture of Bacillus spp. on hydroponically grown lettuce (Lactuca sativa) integrated with tilapia (Orechromis niloticus) aquaculture in a closed-loop system, in comparison with an untreated control. We determined plant growth and crop quality parameters to assess the efficacy of the beneficial microorganisms. A nutrient dynamics analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of Bacillus inoculation on the changes of nutrient concentration in aquaponics solutions, as well as the phosphorus accumulation in several components (fish, plants, water and solids). We performed a plate-count assay to quantify the number microorganisms present in systems inoculated or not with the commercial Bacillus mixture. In general, nutrient dynamics was affected by the inclusion of the Bacillus mixture in the water. Systems that received the product showed faster decreases in ammonia concentration and faster increase in nitrite and nitrate concentrations than the control. The untreated aquaponics systems showed lower accumulation of phosphorus in the water than systems receiving the Bacillus mixture, which resulted in poor plant growth, low phosphorus accumulation in the leaves and low chlorophyll content. However, the mass balance analysis showed that an external source of phosphorus possibly contributed to the overall P budget in systems receiving the Bacillus mixture. The microbial plate count assay demonstrated an active microbiota in aquaponics systems receiving the treatment while untreated systems showed zero microbial counts. The Bacillus mixture used in the present study appears to have PGP properties and to affect P dynamics in aquaponics systems. However, since the product contained traces of phosphorus in its composition, further analysis will be necessary to distinguish whether the advantageous effects promoted by the Bacillus occurred as a result of a beneficial microbial activity or a fertilizing effect.},

Easy maintenance of the orchid allows it to be used as a test system for various fertilizers and nutrient sources, including aquaponic water (AW). First, we applied DNA barcoding to assess the taxonomic identity of this terrestrial orchid and to construct phylogenetic trees. Next, the vegetative organs (leaf, stem, and root) were compared in terms of the level of metabolites (reducing sugars, proteins, anthocyanins, plastid pigments, phenolics, and antioxidant activity) and nutrient elements (carbon, nitrogen, sodium, and potassium), which highlighted the leaves as most functionally active organ. Subsequently, AW was used as a natural source of fish-derived nutrients, and the orchid growth was tested in hydroponics, in irrigated soil, and in an aquaponic system. Plant physiological status was evaluated by analyzing leaf anatomy and measuring chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. These results provided evidence of the beneficial effects of AW on the jewel orchid, including increased leaf formation, enhanced chlorophyll content and photosystems’ productivity, and stimulated and prolonged flowering. The information acquired in the present study could be used in addressing additional aspects of the growth and development of the jewel orchid, which is also known for its medicinal value.},

Hemodialysis consumes large quantities of water. A huge volume of high purity dialysis water is required to safely perform dialysis treatment. In this process, up to 60–70\% of source water is discarded. Many strategies have been suggested to promote green dialysis, and these include reuse of water, however, very few dialysis facilities have taken the preliminary steps to employ it. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We share our experience in a developing country on an innovative reject-water reuse program combining aquaculture, hydroponic and horticulture activities. This is by far the first report on a “green dialysis” project involving aquaponics that reuse dialysis reverse osmosis (RO) reject water. Results\hspace{0.6em} Our expereince suggests that reject water can be reused to promote water conservation with encouraging results. It provides a good and biosecure environment for fish breeding and vegetable farming . This project promotes a reduction in carbon footprint, a reduction in water waste, a sustainable organic food source, may lead to income generation, and provides a shared purpose and sense of pride among staff and dialysis patients. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Encompassing “environmental protection” practices into a hemodialysis unit can be done with relatively simple and practical steps.},

As new adults, college freshmen are often challenged by stress and negative emotions arising from changes in their academic workloads, relationships, emotions, and finances. This experimental study measured changes of Design College in 60 freshmen’s positive emotions across five stages of horticulture, i.e., seedling raising, seedling thinning, transplantation, maintenance and management, and harvest, each of which lasted for 50 minutes. The subjects’ scores on the Positive Emotion Scale were highest for seedling cultivation (4.36/5), and lowest for harvest (3.91/5). This difference between the two stages was significant, while differences between the other stages were not. Aquaponics is combining aquaculture and hydroponic cultivation, and is also known as aquaculture symbiosis; Potted cultivation is associated with traditional continuous cropping in fields. In addition, 60 freshmen were divided into two groups with Aquaponics system and potted cultivation. It was found that, as compared to the 30 participants using traditional potted-horticulture methods, the 30 students engaged in aquaponic planting—which is based on fish and vegetable symbiosis—reported more positive energy and relaxation effects. However, these differences were not significant. The experimental results showed that freshmen's emotions were greatly influenced by three factors: design course, participant's coordination degree and operation content of each phase therapy.},

  abstract = {Vertical farming, an agriculture method allows crops to be grown in an indoor setting with variable stacking systems, controlled temperate, LED lighting and irrigated through hydroponics, aeroponics or aquaponics. This paper reviews existing methods and techniques used for this growing field and its relevance to sustainable urban systems. This paper discusses the need for incorporating urban agriculture in cities, which are majorly importing food. The emerging need arises from the need to address issues such as food waste, food miles, food security and growing population. A review of types of structures suitable for vertical farming and a comparison of various farming technologies is done to evaluate the future urban requirements. The study takes into consideration both micro and macro scale of a city; how vertical farming can operate as a self-sustaining mechanism of buildings and how it can be replicated at community scale. The paper emphasizes on maximum utilization of the spatial context of apartments.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the sustainable reuse of wastewater using fertilizer drawn forward osmosis (FDFO) process through osmotic dilution of commercial nutrient solution for hydroponics, a widely used technique for growing plants without soil. Results from the bench-scale experiments showed that the commercial hydroponic nutrient solution (i.e. solution containing water and essential nutrients) exhibited similar performance (i.e., water flux and reverse salt flux) to other inorganic draw solutions when treating synthetic wastewater. The use of hydroponic solution is highly advantageous since it provides all the required macro- (i.e., N, P and K) and micronutrients (i.e., Ca, Mg, S, Mn, B, Zn and Mo) in a single balanced solution and can therefore be used directly after dilution without the need to add any elements. After long-term operation (i.e. up to 75\% water recovery), different physical cleaning methods were tested and results showed that hydraulic flushing can effectively restore up to 75\% of the initial water flux while osmotic backwashing was able to restore the initial water flux by more than 95\%; illustrating the low-fouling potential of the FDFO process. Pilot-scale studies demonstrated that the FDFO process is able to produce the required nutrient concentration and final water quality (i.e., pH and conductivity) suitable for hydroponic applications. Coupling FDFO with pressure assisted osmosis (PAO) in the later stages could help in saving operational costs (i.e., energy and membrane replacement costs). Finally, the test application of nutrient solution produced by the pilot FDFO process to hydroponic lettuce showed similar growth pattern as the control without any signs of nutrient deficiency.},

  abstract = {Organic solid and liquid wastes contain large amounts of energy, nutrients, and water, and should not be perceived as merely waste. Recycling, composting, and combustion of non-recyclables have been practiced for decades to capture the energy and values from municipal solid wastes. Treatment and disposal have been the primary management strategy for wastewater. As new technologies are emerging, alternative options for the utilization of both solid wastes and wastewater have become available. Considering the complexity of the chemical, physical, and biological properties of these wastes, multiple technologies may be required to maximize the energy and value recovery from the wastes. For this purpose, biorefining tends to be an appropriate approach to completely utilize the energy and value available in wastes. Research has demonstrated that non-recyclable waste materials and bio-solids can be converted into usable heat, electricity, fuel, and chemicals through a variety of processes, and the liquid waste streams have the potential to support crop and algae growth and provide other energy recovery and food production options. In this paper, we propose new biorefining schemes aimed at organic solid and liquid wastes from municipal sources, food and biological processing plants, and animal production facilities. Four new breakthrough technologies—namely, vacuum-assisted thermophilic anaerobic digestion, extended aquaponics, oily wastes to biodiesel via glycerolysis, and microwave-assisted thermochemical conversion—can be incorporated into the biorefining schemes, thereby enabling the complete utilization of those wastes for the production of chemicals, fertilizer, energy (biogas, syngas, biodiesel, and bio-oil), foods, and feeds, and resulting in clean water and a significant reduction in pollutant emissions.},

However, both aquaponic and hydroponic systems require high energy input, leading to potential environmental burdens. This cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA), for the first time, compared the environmental performance, on an economic basis, of aquaponics and hydroponics with identical system design in Indiana, US. For a one-month cultivation period, tilapia and six vegetables produced in the aquaponic system had almost twice the total value of the vegetables from the hydroponic system. Aquaponics produced 45\% lower endpoint environmental impact than hydroponics. Electricity use for greenhouse heating and lighting, and water pumping and heating contributed to the majority of the environmental impacts of both systems, which was followed by the production of fish feed and fertilizers. However, changing the energy source from coal to wind power could make the hydroponic system more environment-friendly than the aquaponic system. This LCA study can provide CEA farmers with the groundwork to reduce the environmental cost of their production.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production sector worldwide and is becoming the main source of aquatic animal foodstuff for human consumption. However, the aquaculture sector has been strongly criticized for its environmental impacts. It can cause discharge and accumulation of residual nutrients in the areas surrounding the production farms. This is because, of the total nutrients supplied to production ponds, only 30\% are converted into product, while the rest is usually discharged into the environment to maintain water quality in aquaculture culture systems, thereby altering the physic-chemical characteristics of the receiving water. In contrast, this same accumulation of nutrients is gaining importance within the agricultural sector, as it has been reported that the main nutrients required by plants for their development are found in this aquaculture waste. The purpose of this review article is to indicate the different aquaculture production systems, the waste they generate, as well as the negative effects of their discharge into the environment. Biofiltration and bioremediation processes are mentioned as alternatives for aquaculture waste management. Furthermore, the state of the art in the treatment and utilization of aquaculture waste as a mineral source for agricultural nutrition through biodigestion and biomineralization processes is described. Finally, aquaponics is referred to as a biological production approach that, through efficient use of water and recycling of accumulated organic nutrients in aquaculture systems, can contribute to addressing the goals of sustainable aquaculture development.},

  abstract = {Bacteria are very vital organisms in aquaponic system decomposing and converting the toxic components of the fish waste into usable vegetable nutrients; however, some unwanted bacteria could cause fish diseases. The purposes of this research were to compare the amount of bacteria in water from aquaponic catfish cultured in different stocking densities and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rDNA was applied to characterise the bacterial populations. Three different stocking densities; 80, 100 and 120 fish/m2 of hybrid catfish were cultured in aquaponic system. Each treatment contained 3 replications; Treatment 1, 360 catfish (80 fish/m2, without lettuce); Treatment 2, 360 catfish (80 fish/m2, without lettuce); Treatment 3, 450 catfish (100 fish/m2); and treatment 4, 540 catfish (120 fish/m2). This research was conducted for 4 months. Water was sampled two times before fish stocking, it was found that the number of bacteria in the first week were higher than the third week. The average number of bacteria in water from treatment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were (2.49 ± 0.40) ×107, (2.43 ± 0.23) ×107, (2.48 ± 2.22) ×107 and (2.29 ± 2.38) ×107 Colonies forming unit (CFU)/ml respectively. According to four-time samplings after catfish were stocked, the average number of bacteria in water from treatment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were (1.85 ± 0.53) ×107, (2.73 ± 0.15) ×107, (2.45 ± 0.30) ×107 and (2.24 ± 0.19) ×107 CFU/ml respectively. The average number of bacteria in water after lettuce harvest from treatment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were (0.185 ± 0.04) ×107, (0.26 ± 0.04) ×107, (0.30 ± 0.01) ×107 and (0.29 ± 0.05) ×107 CFU/ml respectively. There were no differences in bacterial counts among treatments (p {$>$} 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was observed in the number of bacteria in filter tanks (p {$>$} 0.05) and the number were quite similar to the ones in catfish tanks. Aeromonas hydrophila and Flavobacterium columnare infected catfish at the beginning of the experiment; however, it got better and no more death found after acclimation. The DGGE analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA fragments revealed that bacterial populations in water were dominated by Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus spp. Antibiotic sensitivity test indicated that enrofloxacin might be the best option for bacterial infection treatment. The results indicate that aquaponic system could reduce the wastewater from catfish culture; however, maintaining a good water quality environment for fish culture should take into account.},

  abstract = {The unprecedented demand for seafood has resulted in land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), a highly intensive but sustainable fish farming method. However, intensification also results in concentrated waste streams of fecal matter and uneaten feed. Harvesting and processing vast quantities of fish also leads to the production of byproducts, further creating disposal challenges for fish farms. Recent research indicates that anaerobic digestion (AD), often used for waste treatment in agricultural and wastewater industries, may provide a viable solution. Limited research on AD of freshwater, brackish, and saline wastewater from RAS facilities and co-digestion of seafood byproducts has shown promising results but with considerable operational and process stability issues. This review discusses challenges to AD due to low solid concentrations, salinity, low carbon/ nitrogen ratio, and high lipid content in the waste streams. Opportunities for recovering valuable biomolecules and nutrients through microbial treatment, aquaponics, microalgae, and polyhydroxyalkanoate production are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Formulated diets for animals is the primary source of nutrients in aquaponic systems that need to maintain beneficial bacteria as well as for plants. Dietary protein is one of the expensive macronutrients in fish diets, especially when fishmeal is used, and it is the source of nitrogen (N) for other biotic components. Biofloc has the potential to serve as the supplement diet for shrimp and reduce the need of expensive protein. However, it is not clear if low dietary protein will be adequate to support the three organisms (animals, plants, and bacteria) in an aquaponic system operated with biofloc technology. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of shrimp feed with different protein concentrations (30, 35, or 40\%) on water quality and the growth performance of Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and three edible halophytic plants (Atriplex hortensis, Salsola komarovii, and Plantago coronopus) in biofloc-based marine aquaponics. The experiment was conducted for 12 weeks, the plants were harvested and seedlings transplanted every 4 weeks. Dietary protein content did not influence shrimp growth in the current study, indicating that feeds with lower protein concentrations can be used in biofloc-based marine aquaponic systems. During the early and mid-stages of cultivation, plants grew better when supplied diets with higher protein concentration, whereas no differences were observed for later harvests. Hence, for maximum production with mature systems or in the scenario of high concentration of nitrate, providing a higher protein concentration feed in the early stages of system start-up, and switching to a lower protein concentration feed in later stages of cultivation was recommended.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture is a technology used for the production of animal protein but produces a great amount of waste that decreases productivity and adversely affects the environment. Sedimentation and filtration have been used for the treatment of the suspended fraction of these wastes although dissolved substances like nutrients can be an asset. Therefore, the management of aquaculture waste remains a challenge. Aquaponics is a technology that can eliminate dissolved N and P from aquaculture systems as they serve as nutrients for plants, which are absorbed through the roots and are incorporated into their tissues. Several reports and studies exist on the benefits of aquaponic systems for the combined production of plants and aquatic organisms and its advantages in terms of economics and environmental protection. The great majority of the studies use the wastewater from the aquatic production tanks as a source of nutrients for plants production. However, domestic or municipal wastewater is a resource that has been used extensively in other production systems such as conventional agriculture and aquaculture, yet its potential as a source of water for aquaponics has not been established. The current analysis hypothesizes that reclaimed water can be used for aquaponics. Despite the extensive use of reclaimed water in agriculture and aquaculture and the low risk to human health when properly managed, there are no academic studies that have tackled this issue. In order to overcome the generalized mistrust of the public in consuming crops irrigated with reclaimed water or fish growing in reclaimed water, it is recommended that only ornamental fish and plants would be cultivated by this method. There is an urgent need for studies to verify the safety and advantages of such cultivation technique. Finally, it is necessary to establish guidelines for the responsible use of reclaimed water in aquaponics.},

This study compares the additive life cycles of traditional, large-scale lettuce and tilapia production with combined aquaponic agriculture to evaluate these methods based on their material efficiency and their associated environmental impacts. Analysis of the midpoint and endpoint characterizations show significantly reduced impacts on eutrophication, water usage, and geographic footprint of aquaponics, which leverages the symbiotic ecosystem productivity absent in current conventional agriculture. The analysis also indicates that the greatest potential for sustainable improvement of aquaponics technology and adoption is in its efficiency and material inputs, or fish feed. This argues coupling aquaponics with other material production-recycling networks may yield symbioses that can further increase long term potential for aquaponics as an important and resilient food production system.},

The comparison is between the carbon emissions resultant from operating a large-scale vegetable box system and those from a supply system where the customer travels to a local farm shop. The study is based on fuel and energy use data collected from one of the UK’s largest suppliers of organic produce. The findings suggest that if a customer drives a round-trip distance of more than 6.7 km in order to purchase their organic vegetables, their carbon emissions are likely to be greater than the emissions from the system of cold storage, packing, transport to a regional hub and final transport to customer’s doorstep used by large-scale vegetable box suppliers. Consequently some of the ideas behind localism in the food sector may need to be revisited.},

  abstract = {One potential advantage of aquaponic systems is reduced resource consumption compared to separate fish and plant rearing systems, but little has been published on the costs of providing nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients by fish in comparison to the purchase of inorganic fertilizers. The cost of providing nitrogen and phosphorus from six commercial fish feeds was compared to 9 commercial agricultural fertilizers. Waste production from fish was corrected for excretion of urea and the impact of feed wastage. For a typical aquaponic system without mineralization of fecal solids, the soluble nitrogen and phosphorus excretion ranged from 36.9 to 44.0 g/kg feed and 1.4–3.7 g/kg feed, respectively. The cost to provide 1 kg of nutrients from feeds ranged from \$15-\$29/kg for nitrogen and from \$115 - \$583/kg for phosphorus. Compared to the purchase of these elements from inorganic fertilizers, the feeds were 7–14 times more expensive for nitrogen and 17–88 times more expensive for phos­ phorus. The feed/fertilizer cost ratio (FFCRfeed) required to replace the nitrogen and phosphorus in 1 kg of feed ranged from 2 to 4 times for monoammonium phosphate to 14–17 times for anhydrous ammonia and triple superphosphate. Based on the specific conditions and assumptions in this work, the economic value of nutrients provided by fish in aquaponic systems has been greatly over-stated.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics where nutrients released by growing fish are utilized by plants grown in a soilless culture, often in a controlled environment. Potential advantages of aquaponics include improved sustainability, reduced resource consumption, and fewer environmental impacts compared to conventional aquaculture. Based on a 2014 survey, it was found that most respondents were practicing aquaponics as a hobby. Other groups of respondents were educators, non-profit organizations that operate aquaponic systems, commercial operators, and consultants that sell goods, material, and services. Although many proponents cite the opportunity to create a commercially viable food production system few (if any) ventures have demonstrated sustainable financial outcomes. In general, much of the peer-reviewed aquaponic publications and popular literature, and despite the efforts of some investigators, lacks a methodical scientific basis for describing the essential mechanics, relationships, and culture methods within aquaponic systems. Many systems evolved from small-scale experimental facilities devised by trial and error methods and were implemented with locally limited appropriate species, limited finances, and distorted market situations. Many of the published aquaponic experiments are based on small systems, short growth trials, and weak experimental design. The predominant system design approach is based on a relatively small number of experiments. This review introduces notation and algorithms that are intended to standardize the numerous critical values essential in aquaponics for purposes of determining design criteria and operational parameters including flows, the concentration of water quality constituents, metabolite production, and productivity of plant and animal segments in an aquaponic systems. The objective of this systematic approach is to employ scientific methods that provide research results that can be replicated, challenged, and improved. This methodology is expected to facilitate more rapid development of scientific information, productive systems, and rational economic applications. This approach is crucial for commercial applications where production cost, product value, and investment returns are of critical importance for practitioners that envision investment in new ventures. For hobbyists and educators, economic issues may not be as important as the self-sufficiency and natural synergism aspects, personal satisfaction, and the learning experience that result from existing state-of-the-art of aquaponic practices. These outcomes remain for all and a clearer understanding of smaller personal systems is likely to be enhanced.},

  abstract = {Despite recent progress, knowledge on protein and amino acid (AA) requirements of fish larvae is limited. The major differences compared to larger fish seem to be a poorer capacity to digest and/or absorb complex proteins. In addition, the cumulative needs for protein deposition, protein turnover and AA catabolism necessary for rapid larval growth dictate a higher AA requirement during the larval stages. However, fish larvae seem to have an efficient control of AA catabolism, and use dispensable preferentially to indispensable AA as energy substrates. Still, larvae of most marine fish species hatch with a simple digestive tract and a poorly developed ability to digest proteins, and a fully mature protein digestion is only available weeks later. Therefore, fish larvae need diets rich in soluble molecular nitrogen, and avoiding complex proteins with low digestibility. The use of the indispensable AA profile of fish larvae as index of their requirements needs caution. Ontogenetic changes in the AA profile during larval stages need to be considered, and some AA are more efficiently absorbed and/or retained by fish larvae. In short, despite considerable progress in understanding protein utilisation in recent years, many questions remain open in relation to AA requirements of fish larvae.},

However, most controlled microclimatic cultivation chambers are equipped with low-cost RGB camera for crop growth monitoring. The lack of camera credentials specially the wavelength sensitivity of visible band provides added challenge in materializing greenness index. The proposed method in this study compensates the unavailability of generic camera peak wavelength sensitivities by employing genetic algorithm (GA) to derive a visible band triangular greenness index (TGI) based on green waveband signal normalized TGI model called gvTGI. The selection, mutation and crossover rates used in configuring the GA model are 0.2, 0.01 and 0.8 respectively. Lettuce images are captured from an aquaponic cultivation chamber for 6-week crop life cycle. The annotated and extracted gvTGI channels are inputted to deep learning models of MobileNetV2, ResNet101 and InceptionResNetV2 for estimation of photosynthetic growth signatures at canopy scale. In predicting cultivation period in weeks after germination, MobileNetV2 bested other image classification models with accuracy of 80.56\%. In estimating canopy area, MobileNetV2 bested other image regression models with R2 of 0.9805. The proposed gvTGI proved to be highly accurate on estimation of photosynthetic growth signatures by using generic RGB camera, thus, providing a low-cost alternative for crop phenotyping.},

  abstract = {Crops that are cultivated in aquaponics setup highly relies on the nutrients supplied by the aqueous system through fish effluents. Continuous monitoring of essential elemental nutrients requires expensive sensors and arrays of it for full scale deployment. However, sustainable agriculture demands energy consumption reduction and cost-effectiveness. This study employed device minimization by utilizing a combination of physical water sensors, namely temperature and electrical conductivity sensors, to predict total organic carbon (TOC) and hydrogen ion (H) concentrations in pond water. Aquaphotomics through ultraviolet (UV) and visible light (Vis) wavelength sweeping from 250 to 500 nm was explored to determine the nutrient biomarkers of pond water samples that undergoes temperature perturbation from 16 to 36 °C with 2 °C increment per testing. Principal component analysis (PCA) selected the most relevant activated water bands which are 275 nm for TOC and 415 nm for H. Direct spectrophotometric TOC concentration data was passed through a Savitzky-Golay filter to smoothen the nutrient signal. Recurrent neural network (RNN) exhibited the fastest inference time of 3.5 seconds on the average with R2 of 0.8583 and 0.9686 for predicting TOC and H concentrations. Multigene symbolic regression genetic programming (MSRGP) exhibited the best R2 performances of 0.9280 and 0.9693 in predicting TOC and H concentrations by using only the temperature and electrical conductivity sensoracquired data. This developed model is an innovative approach on measuring chemical concentrations of water using physical limnological sensors which resulted to energy consumption reduction of 50 \% for complete 42-day crop life cycle of lettuce.},

  abstract = {Crop quality depends dominantly on the nutrients present in its growth media. For precision farming, fertigation is a challenge, especially when dealing with economical and efficiency factors. In this study, the aquaponic pond water macronutrient prediction model (wNPK) was developed based on leaf photosynthetic signature predictors. Aquaphotomics was preliminarily used for correlating physical limnological properties with nitrate, phosphate, potassium concentrations, and the leaf signatures. Using a digital camera, 18 spectro-textural-morphological features were extracted. Neighborhood component analysis (NCA) and ReliefF algorithms selected the spectral components blue, a*, and red minus luma as the most significant as supported by principal component analysis, resulting in low computational cost. A Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) was employed to optimize the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture resulting in higher sensitivity. The hybrid NCA-ReliefF-GSA-RNN (wNPK) predicted NPK with 93.61, 84.03, and 91.39 \% accuracy, respectively, besting out other configured feature-based machine learning models. Using wNPK, it was confirmed that potassium helped in accelerating seed germination and nitrogen in promoting chlorophyll intensification, especially on the 6th week after sowing. Phosphate and potassium were the energy and health elements that were consumed in a larger amount at the end of the head development stage. wNPK rules out that macronutrient concentration have a direct resemblance to crop leaf signatures; thus, a leaf is a good indicator of the water quality. The results pointed out that the use of a single camera to measure both water macronutrient concentrations and crop signature at the same time is an innovative, efficient, and economical approach for precision farming.},

  abstract = {Crop water stress is avoidable particularly for controlled agriculture. Due to high cost and elaborated laboratory process of measuring crop water consumption, it is not often monitored. However, water stress indicators are needed for water management. This study employed integrated computer vision, feature-based machine learning and deep transfer image networks in predicting lettuce canopy full moisture content (FMC) and equivalent water thickness (EWT) as measures of water stress. A total of 330 irrigated and nonirrigated aquaponic lettuces were collected from head development to harvest stage in a 42-day crop life cycle, and an extended 7 days for drought-induced senescence. Oven dehydration was used to extract fresh and dry leaf weights. Graph-cut segmentation using lazysnapping algorithm eliminated non-vegetation pixels. Neighborhood component analysis (NCA) selected the most impactful thermo-visible phenotypic signatures which are R, G, B, a* and Y color components, morphological canopy area, and thermal crop water stress index (CWSI). Recurrent neural network (RNN) optimized by evolutionary strategy (ES) exhibited the best FMC and EWT predictions with R2 performance of 0.9233 and 0.8155 respectively, and efficient inference time of 7.5 seconds on the average. There is FMC increase of 2.9845\%°C-1 and EWT of 0.4632 gcm-2°C-1 increase in lettuce canopy surface. FMC increases by 3.1996\% and 0.0212 gcm-2 for EWT per square centimeter growth in canopy area. Third week after germination lettuces with FMC of above 90\% and EWT below 0.4 gcm-2 yield greener canopies. This developed ES-RNN model exhibits a reliable, sensitive, and real-time approach in lettuce water stress computational assessment.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic toxicity relies on the combinations of its pollution parameters that are dissolved in water and emitted in air. Ammonia is considered as an important indicator affecting aquaculture species, water nutrient imbalance and air pollution. Trophic state of aquatic body is measured by ammonia. In this study, the suitability of metaheuristic models, namely, genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, water cycle algorithm, enhanced vibrating particles system and particle swarm optimization, in determining the optimum condition of ammonia factor for providing minimal toxicity and oligotrophication was determined by varying its corresponding hyperparameters. The parameters that were optimized are water temperature and pH level. These parameters significantly affect ammonia factor that is an essential contributor to eutrophication. The optimized genetic algorithm yielded the practical-ideal fitness function value for ammonia factor as to compare with other optimized metaheuristics based on optimizing time. It selected the 50 fittest individuals based on their fitness score with the rate of 0.2 and proceeds to recombination process to extract characteristics from parent chromosomes with crossover rate of 0.8. The mutation rate of 0.01 was injected to form diversity and to test if the global solution was attained. The tournament size is 4 and the reproduction elite count is 2.5. The best condition of the ammonia factor was extracted when the number of generations has been reached. The GA results showed that the optimum condition for ammonia factor that will prevent eutrophication and provide ecological balance in aquaponic system needs a temperature of 29.254 °C and pH of 7.614.},

  abstract = {Biological degradation of fish waste solids in the anaerobic zones of settling basins can reduce water quality and increase the environmental impact of aquaculture farms. The objectives of this study were to measure the rate of hydrolysis of waste solids from a salmon smolt hatchery and to investigate the concomitant dissolution of phosphorus and nitrogen. Hydrolysis followed first order kinetics with a reaction time constant of about 2 days. The rate of production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) appeared to be limited by the rate of conversion of solids into soluble organic material. The total ammonia–nitrogen concentration increased linearly with VFA concentration. As the pH dropped due to the generation of VFA, the concentrations of dissolved phosphorus and calcium increased, especially once the pH dropped below 6.5. Solids content had little effect on dissolved phosphorus concentration within the range of solids concentrations tested (0.5 wt.\%–9.02 wt.\%). The effect of pH on the dissolved phosphorus and calcium concentrations is well described by an equilibrium model based on the solubility of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate.},

This paper aims firstly to assess nitrogen flows and to highlight hotspots of inefficient use of nitrogen along the European food chain, excluding primary production. Secondly, it aims to analyse the potential for reducing the identified inefficiencies and increase nitrogen circularity. A baseline and three scenarios-reflecting waste targets reported in EU legislation and technological improvements- are analysed. Results highlighted a potential to reduce reactive nitrogen emissions up to more than 45\%. However, this would imply the conversion of reactive nitrogen in molecular nitrogen, such as urea, before re-entering in the food chain. Techniques to harvest reactive nitrogen directly from urine and wastewater are considered promising to increase nitrogen use efficiency along the food chain.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the production of two water plants, Foxtail (Myriophyllum aquaticum) and Water Clover (Limnobium laevigatum) with potential for fodder use, integrated with tilapia cultivation (Oreochromis niloticus), as an alternative for animal feed and its ability to absorb nitrates. Because this investigation is still in progress, preliminary data is presented related to nitrate absorption. According to data registered until today, Myriophyllum aquaticum presented higher nitrates absorption than Limnobium laevigatum, however, observed concentration values of this compound is lower as reported in literature as toxic for animal consumption.},

  abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the opportunity of integrating aquaponics as an environmentally preferable pro­ curement (EPP) solution in Romania, meant to improve productivity and sustainability of both agriculture and aquaculture and to reduce conflicts between these two sectors. The Romanian production of plant species is evaluated and forecasted considering only the main species that can be commonly produced in aquaponics conditions, as follows: coriander, spinach, lettuce, tobacco, garlic, cucumber, tomatoes, and strawberries. The evaluation of the opportunity for integrating aquaponics into Romania, at a large scale, is evaluated using forecast analysis comparison between Romania and the European Union (EU), by applying six methods (expo­ nential smoothing, Holt, Holt exponential, Holt damped, ARIMA, LSTM). Thus, comparative forecast analysis between Romania and the EU average values were developed considering four dimensions, as follows: aqua­ culture production, agriculture plant production for main species suitable to be cultivated in aquaponics con­ ditions, organic agriculture surface and the amount of pesticides and insecticides used. Romania’s aquaculture production forecast indicates a superior upward trend compared with the EU average. Also, the agriculture production of the main plant species suitable for cultivation in aquaponics conditions records an inconsistent decreasing trend in Romania, compared with the upward trend recorded by analyzing the EU average value. The forecast of organic agriculture surface in Romania emphasizes a higher increasing trend compared to the EU average, situation which reveals a sustainable development direction, confirmed also by the decreasing fore­ casted trend of the amount of pesticides and insecticides used in agriculture. The registered results recommend the integration of aquaponics production systems into the Romanian green procurement network, considering also the EU context.},

Small seeds develop inside fertile segments of its cylindrical leafless shoots and, at the harvest, seeds are typically mixed with remnant cellulose material difficult to separate. This work evaluated different extraction methods and the composition of total esterified fatty acids in a meal of ground fertile shoots of S. ambigua, seeking for an alternative primary matter and larger yield of total lipids. The highest lipid yield was obtained with a chloroform:methanol mixture (2:1)(v/v) (5.2\% of dry weight). The most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids in the meal were linoleic acid (C18:2; 21.4\%) and oleic acid (C18:1; 18.3\%). Fifty six percent of the lipids in S. ambigua meal were saturated and palmitic acid (C16:0) was the main fraction (19.8\%). Long-chain fatty acids (≥ C20) represented 29.5\% of the lipids. Most abundant long-chain fatty acids were behenic acid (C22:0; 7.1\%), lignoceric acid (C24:0; 5.3\%) and montanic acid (C28:0; 4.0\%). The percentage of saturated lipids in S. ambigua meal was higher than that of vegetable oils with a MUFA nutritional profile and some of these lipids have known bioactive properties.},

  abstract = {Sarcocornia ambigua is a perennial halophyte with edible shoots that might be used for human and animal feeding, as well as its seed oil is recommended for animal consumption or biofuel production. A field experiment with a 1,600 m² plot was performed from November 2009 to December 2010, in the inland semi-arid region of NE Brazil (city of Ocara, CE) to evaluate the response of S. ambigua to four saline irrigation regimes on growth and yield. The irrigation regimes (treatments) were: 120\% (T1), 160\% (T2), 200\% (T3) and 240\% (T4) of the annual average of monthly potential evapotranspiration (113 mm). The saline well water used for irrigation had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 5.9 dS m-1, average air temperature was 28.8 ± 1.3 °C and annual precipitation reached 613 mm (2010 data). The global average of soil EC1:2 during the rainy season (November 2009 to May 2010) was 22.7 ± 0.9 dS m-1 and did not differ among soils of irrigation regimes, whereas during the drought season (June to December 2010) the soil EC1:2 was significantly different (p{$<$} 0.01) between T1 (52.5 ± 5.7 dS m-1) and T4 (39.0 ± 5.9 dS m-1). The application of excess water over 240\% that needed for evapotranspiration (T4) prevent excess accumulation of salts in the root zone. S. ambigua showed to be highly productive under local conditions. After 24 weeks of the rainy season, S. ambigua reached an average shoot yield (fresh weight) of 14.7 ± 1.9 t ha-1 and the average fresh biomass of individual plants was positively correlated with soil moisture (r²= 0.681, p{$<$} 0.01). After the harvest, plants sprouted and grow 29 more weeks during the drought season, thereafter they yield an average of 21.7 ± 3.4 t ha-1. Most of plants flourished but they allocated only 3\% of the biomass to reproductive segments. The low plant fecundity was probably related to characteristics of the local red-yellow podzolic soil.},

  abstract = {The objective of the present study was to evaluate the quality of the pretreatment (in natura) and posttreatment water in the city of Jundiaí-SP. It also aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the water treatment of the municipality. Three sampling points were evaluated in the city: the source of the Jundiaí-Mirim River (p1), the accumulation dam located in the City Park (p2), and the posttreatment tap water from the distribution network (p3). The evaluation of the physicochemical parameters (dissolved oxygen-DO, hydrogenation potential-pH, orthophosphate-, nitrite-, nitrate-, ammonia-NH3, turbidity and temperature) and microbiological (thermotolerant coliform-CT) was performed with the use of Alfakit® Ecokit II. Nonconformities were observed only in relation to the microbiological parameter: p1 presented 2,2 x 103 CFU/mL and p2, 1,8 x 103 CFU/mL; CONAMA Resolution 357/05 establishes up to 2 x 102 CFU/mL for class I. Tap water is in compliance with the reference values established by the Ministry of Health Ordinance 2914/11. The methods used were effective to certify good quality of the water after the rigorous treatment done by the DAE company, however additional studies are suggested for the identification of possible contaminants in the region. .},

  abstract = {In livestock grazing environments, the knowledge of C3/C4 species composition of a pasture field is invaluable, since such information assists graziers in making decisions around fertilizer application and stocking rates. The general aim of this research was to explore the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to discriminate between C3, C4, and mixed-C3/C4 compositions. In this study, three Random Forest (RF) classification models were created using features derived from polarimetric SAR (polSAR) and grey-level co-occurrence textural metrics (glcmTEX). The first RF model involved only polSAR features and produced a prediction accuracy of 68\% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.49. The second RF model used glcmTEX features and produced prediction accuracies of 76\%, 62\%, and 75\% for C3, C4, and mixed C3/C4 grasses, respectively. The glcmTEX model achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 73\% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.57. The polSAR and glcmTEX features were then combined (COMB model) to improve upon their individual classification performances. The COMB model produced prediction accuracies of 89\%, 81\%, and 84\% for C3, C4, and mixed C3/C4 pasture grasses, and an overall prediction accuracy of 86\% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.77. The contribution of the various model features could be attributed to the changes in dominant species between sampling sites through time, not only because of climatic variability but also because of preferential grazing.},

  abstract = {Global agricultural markets reflect the increasing complexity of modern consumer demand for food safety and quality. This demand has triggered changes throughout the food industry, and led to greater opportunities for product differentiation and the potential to add value to raw commodities. Greater differentiation and value adding over time has in turn dramatically changed the price spread or marketing bill between the farm value of products and the retail value. Thus a significantly greater percentage of the final price paid by consumers is now garnered down chain rather than up chain over the last 20 years. This apparent shifting of value creation or addition, as measured by the marketing margin, has invigorated empirical questions as to where, and how much value, is created along the agri-food value chain. First we define value creation/ adding, and then we estimate the economic value added for 454 firms. We validate our findings by creating and employing three additional value creation measures – the modified economic value added, the creation or destruction of value, and the persistence of value creation. Finally we estimate value creation at each node of the value chain, measure the relative differences among firms and nodes, and estimate a model measuring the drivers of value adding.},

The user must also provide data from the outside climate (air temperature and humidity, wind speed and solar radiation) or, for the cases that this data is not available, it must be provided relevant inputs to generate this data (such as geographical location of the greenhouse, day of the year to be used in the simulation, define boundaries for outside air temperatures, among others). The simulations can be computed and displayed using time intervals from 5 to 60 minutes for a defined day of the year. Several simulations are presented and discussed with the aim of addressing the potentials and the applicability of this software tool. Namely, it will be illustrated the potential of this tool in helping growers to design or improve their greenhouses.},

  abstract = {Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have gained increasing interest in recent years as a means to intensify fish production while at the same time minimize the environmental impact. Considerable hands-on experience has accumulated within the Nordic countries over the last 20-30 years in designing, building, and operating intensive land-based RAS for different species. This study compiles and assesses published literature along with un-published hands-on experiences with rearing different species in RAS in the Nordic countries, including Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), European eel (Anguilla anguilla), pike perch (Stizostedion lucioperca), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), sturgeon (order Acipenseriformes), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and European lobster (Homarus gammarus). High capital costs are one of the biggest challenges to sustainable RAS calling for large scale intensive productions to reduce investment and operation costs. Consistent with this, production of Atlantic salmon smolts in indoor RAS and rainbow trout in outdoor Model-Trout-Farms (MTFs) have been the commercially most successful productions so far. Aside from end-of-pipe treatment including sludge handling and efficient nitrogen removal, much of the RAS technology applied is well known and is, as such, more or less ready to apply for culturing a variety of species. Successful production of " new" species in RAS therefore largely comes down to identifying the biological requirements of that specific species, and designing the RAS to fulfill and support the specific requirements. Well established brood-stocks and continuous supply of offspring is furthermore a prerequisite for successful RAS production of most species. Successful operations of less intensive RAS such as aquaponic systems appear to be feasible primarily when culturing more exotic species targeted for selected customers. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture as a source of fish protein will continue to rise in importance in the coming decades. There exists the potential to develop Building Integrated Aquaculture (BIAq) incorporating holistic design approaches that will efficiently couple closed-loop aquaculture systems with the built environment. These integrated systems will become necessary if we are to develop local sources of food supply close to urban markets in temperate climates. This paper analyzes the role of nature in the design of such systems. We draw on the principles of Ecological Design to describe the role that natural systems can play in optimizing the performance of BIAq systems. We also incorporate a systems thinking approach in the context of BIAq design. A review of the literature analyzes the interaction of technical and natural systems in BIAq where the specific considerations for aquaculture production must be considered in concert with sustainable design of the built environment. Three main design issues will be explored: 1) Energy efficiency and the interaction of water mass with passive solar design including consideration of building envelope materials, space heating, water heating, and lighting demands; 2) Humidity control and natural ventilation; and 3) Natural hydroponic systems to close the nutrient loop with the aquaculture production systems. Design strategies are described and recommendations are provided.},

  abstract = {This experiment evaluated petunia (Petunia ·hybrida ‘Celebrity’) growth response to amending a commercial potting mix (F3B) with different amounts of dewatered aquaculture effluent (AE) and fertigating with a water-soluble, inorganic fertilizer or municipal water. The experiment was a completely randomized 2 · 5 factorial design with eight single-pot replications per treatment. At 39 days after planting (DAP), a significant (P £ 0.05) substrate and water interaction existed for petunia growth index (GI), bloom count (BC), fresh weight (FW), and dry weight (DW). The 100\% F3B, 5\% AE, and 10\% AE substrates benefited with a significantly (P £ 0.05) greater BC, FW, and DW when fertigation was used; however, the water source had no effect on petunia BC, FW, or DW for levels ‡25\% AE. Fertigating substrates amended with increasing levels of AE did not improve petunia growth. Conversely, when applying municipal water plant, FW and DW were the greatest using 25\% AE.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics systems and technologies are growing primary industries in many countries, with high environmental and socio-economic advantages. Aquaponics is a closed-loop system that produces aquatic animals and plants in a new way using recirculated water and nutrients. With a growing world population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, food production sustainability is a primary issue in today’s world agenda, and aquaponics and aquaculture systems can be potential contributors to the challenge. Observing the climate changes and global warming’s impact on the ecosystem, decreasing aqua animal stocks, and responding to increasing demand are turning points in the sustainability era. In the past 15 years, fish production has doubled, thus denoting that aquaponics transforms into commercial scales with a revolutionized production, high efficiency, and fewer resources’ utilization, thus requiring proper operation and management standards and practices. Therefore, this study aims to shape a new framework for sustainable aquaponics modeling and utilization as the all-in-one solution platform covering technical, managerial, socio-economic, institutional, and environmental measures within the suitability requirements. The proposed model in this study offers a systematic approach to the design and implementation of sustainability-efficient aquaponics and aquaculture systems. Through an exhaustive coverage of the topic, this research effort can be counted as a practical reference for researchers, scholars, experts, practitioners, and students in the context of aquaponics and aquaculture studies.},

This work thus assessed the effects of a phytase-supplemented diet on the P dynamics, P availability, P budget, fish and plant growth parameters, and carcass composition of Nile tilapia and phosphorus content of lettuce plants in aquaponic systems. The diet supplemented with phytase at the concentration of 1000 FTU kg−1 showed a significant increase in released phosphorus compared to the control in an in vitro assay. Phytase supplementation increased accumulation of phosphorus in fish carcass compared to the control, but did not affect growth performance. The addition of phytase to fish diets improved phosphorus utilization by fish, reducing phosphorus excretion. The lower amount of phosphorus excreted in the water caused by phytase did not impair the growth or phosphorus content of lettuce grown using the aquaponic nutrient solution. It is recommended that, even though the use of phytase in fish feeds increased the overall utilization of phosphorus in the present study, a small portion of inorganic phosphorus must be supplemented to meet minimum fish requirements.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics practitioners have empirically known for years that feeding and growing fish generates nutrient-rich water as a byproduct, which serves as fertilizer to grow plants that ultimately clean the water for the fish. Despite the efforts of a few investigators, the literature lacks a methodical scientific basis for describing the essential mechanics, relationships between element inputs and outputs within aquaponic systems. We proposed a simple highthroughput batch reactor assay for the prediction of nutrient inputs in aquaponics that can quickly determine the nutrient bioavailability and release rate of nutrients for any fish feed. We defined the term “nutrient release coefficient” as the conversion efficiency measurement of the quantity of a certain element excreted by fish in the dissolved form in the water to a unit of the same ingested element present in the feed. We proved that nutrient release coefficients are quite constant among different groups of fish and within the same group of fish sampled in different periods of time. This study confirmed that there is a major imbalance not only in the nutrient contents in fish diets, but also a major discrepancy in nutrient release dynamics since fish assimilate and excrete different elements at distinct rates (Ca\,{$<$}\,P\,{$<$}\,Mg\,{$<$}\,N\,{$<$}\,K\,{$<$}\,S). Results of nutrient release coefficient assays can be successfully replicated when fish size, feed, temperature, physiological solution, and oxygen saturation are maintained equal. This assay could be an alternative to long and cumbersome fish/plant ratio studies in aquaponics research.},

  abstract = {The intensification of aquaculture has emerged as a viable alternative for increasing aquaculture production due to competition that arose from the use of natural resources, such as land and water, by other production and developmental sectors. However, intensification demands increased inputs, such as fish and feed per unit culture area and, therefore, increased waste generation from the aquaculture production systems. The impact of waste products from aquaculture has increased public concern and threatens the sustainability of aquaculture practices. The need for increasing the production of aquaculture products cannot be overemphasized and, therefore, there is a need to develop culture systems that will increase fish production with efficient waste management in order to limit environmental degradation resulting from aquaculture wastes and ensure its sustainability. This paper reviewed various aspects of waste production from aquaculture, their sources, components, and methods of management, in different culture systems, primarily discussing waste production from feed, chemicals, and pathogens. We aimed to establish the sources of wastes, their contents, and potential harms to both the fish culture and the environment. Suggestions for managing wastes in different culture systems were made to ensure an improved and sustainable aquaculture production.},

This is, in essence, the simplest form of a low head oxygenator (LHO). A regression equation was developed to predict G20 as a function of these variables, their interactions, and squared terms. The hydraulic head above the flooded plate had no significant effect (P B0.10) on the overall mass transfer coefficient. It was determined that the contribution of the orifice hole solely to overall gas transfer was much less than previously assumed, suggesting that a much larger percentage of gas transfer is due to the splashing and subsequent entrainment as water droplets fall into the receiving pool of water. Practical implications of the results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Biofloc technology (BFT) has been called an environmentally friendly aquaculture approach. The sustainable characteristics of biofloc-based culture are usually linked to the efficient use of water and nutrients and the minimal discard of effluent to the environment. Given the scarcity of sustainability assessment of biofloc-based systems, it is still unclear whether the positive characteristics of BFT make it a real sustainable approach for aquaculture. This study aimed to investigate and apply the emergy synthesis to assess the sustainability of commercial Nile tilapia fingerlings production in a biofloc-based system. The tilapia fingerlings produced on the BFT farm showed a UEV of 2.04E + 03 sej/J, renewability of 32.73\%, EYR of 1.00, EIR, and ELR of 2.05, and ESI of 0.49. Compared to other aquaculture systems, the evaluated BFT farm presented emergy indicators with values characteristic of potentially sustainable production. Electricity has the highest representativeness in the emergy input, making the system dependent on resources from the larger economy. The low UEV indicates that the BFT farm is efficient in terms of converting the invested emergy into the system’s output (tilapia fingerlings). A sensitivity analysis shows that replacing the hydroelectric source of electricity with photovoltaic will not improve the emergy performance of the evaluated BFT farm.},

  abstract = {The search for healthier protein sources and the growing demand for food by an increasing world population require aquaculture systems to not only be economically and technologically viable, but also sustainable. Among other methods, emergy synthesis is a powerful tool to assess the sustainability of production systems in a biophysical perspective. However, applications of emergy synthesis on aquaculture systems are seldomly found in the scientific literature. This work provides a literature review on emergy synthesis applied to aquaculture systems and discusses its constraints and potentials. The sixteen papers published between 2000-2020 support the adoption of polycultures more than monocultures and highlight the importance of feed (4–70\%) in the total emergy required by aquaculture systems, which require efforts for natural food. Methodological aspects of emergy synthesis applied in aquaculture systems that deserve attention by developers and analysts to avoid mistakes and erroneous conclusions were identified and discussed, and we propose some ways to solve them. These aspects are mainly related to inaccurate unit emergy values for water and feed, dubious procedures in quantifying and classifying water as renewable or non-renewable resources, and the need to recognize the importance in accounting for ecosystem services and disservices. After overcoming these methodological inconsistencies, we foresee that emergy synthesis has potential political implications in supporting most sustainable aquaculture systems through economic (tax reduction and loans with reduced interests) and political (green labels) incentives. All these policies are important to achieve the ultimate goals of the United Nations’ Agenda 2030.},

  abstract = {Two studies were conducted to evaluate rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss health and welfare within replicated water recirculating aquaculture systems (WRAS) that were operated at low and near-zero water exchange, with and without ozonation, and with relatively high feed loading rates. During the first study, rainbow trout cultured within WRAS operated with low water exchange (system hydraulic retention time (HRT) = 6.7 days; feed loading rate = 4.1 kg feed/m3 daily makeup flow) exhibited increased swimming speeds as well as a greater incidence of “side swimming” behavior as compared to trout cultured in high exchange WRAS (HRT = 0.67 days; feed loading rate = 0.41 kg feed/m3 daily makeup flow). During the second study, when the WRAS were operated at near-zero water exchange, an increased percentage of rainbow trout deformities, as well as increased mortality and a variety of unusual swimming behaviors were observed within WRAS with the highest feed loading rates and least water exchange (HRT ≥ 103 days; feed loading rate ≥ 71 kg feed/m3 daily makeup flow). A wide range of water quality variables were measured. Although the causative agent could not be conclusively identified, several water quality parameters, including nitrate nitrogen and dissolved potassium, were identified as being potentially associated with the observed fish health problems.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a food production system that aims higher sustainability by integrating advantages gained from aquaculture and hydroponic production. Aquaponics aims to mimic the biological process that happens in the natural environment in a controlled production system. As it can be applied to small scales, aquaponics is considered an important alternative for urban regions, which have low availability of agricultural land and water resources. Furthermore, the advantage is that it is located close to final consumers. Aquaponics has been labeled as an environmentally friendly food production system, but its demand for energy and materials cast doubt on its sustainability. A systemic understanding of aquaponics production systems is needed to determine the magnitude and balance between its potentialities and constraints, in which emergy synthesis appears as a powerful tool for this purpose. This study applies emergy synthesis to assess the sustainability of two different (scale and marketable products) urban aquaponics farms in Brazil, but differently from other emergy studies, ecosystem services and disservices are included in the analysis as an attempt to represent the system performance holis­ tically. Results show that the type of materials used in aquaponics infrastructures has the highest influence on total emergy demand. Surprisingly, electricity and fish feed showed a low influence on the total emergy, rein­ forcing the idea that aquaponics systems have a more efficiency feeding management than traditional aqua­ culture systems. Besides producing vegetables and fish, the inclusion of ecosystem services highlights the importance of aquaponics for educational and tourism purposes. Finally, the obtained indicators from modeling scenarios revealed that replacing the water source and some materials deserves priority attention to increase the sustainability of urban aquaponics farms.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of population, a decrease of agricultural land, global climate change, and immobilization of food supplies due to the pandemic have led to increasing demand for food supplies. To address food security, sustainable climate-smart agriculture has been very popular. This includes the Aquaponics system, a food production system in which fish and plants are grown in a simulated closed ecosystem. In this system, the wastes from the fish in the water containing nitrogen are converted to fertilizer foods for the plants along with the process of filtering the water to be recycled back into the tank. However, the aquaponics system should be a balanced environment where fishes and plants thrive properly. To achieve this, the present study on the Internet of Things (IoT) based aquaponics system plays a significant role. The microcontroller-based system can monitor the water quality in terms of PH, temperature, and oxygen level of the water using various sensors. It can then automatically control the actuators based on the sensor parameters regulating the water. It has web and mobile applications that enable user-friendly remote connections with cloud-based data repository features. It can work in autonomy where it can immediately rectify aberrations promptly based on any changes in the parameters of the water. Furthermore, the system uses solar power. The experts and users gave an average approval rating of 4 .32 that implies the reliability, efficiency, applicability, portability, and economic feasibility of the system.},

  abstract = {The demand for food will outpace productivity of conventional agriculture due to projected growth of the human population, concomitant with shrinkage of arable land, increasing scarcity of freshwater, and a rapidly changing climate. While aquaponics has potential to sustainably supplement food production with minimal environmental impact, there is a need to better characterize the complex interplay between the various components (fish, plant, microbiome) of these systems to optimize scale up and productivity. Here, we investigated how the commonly-implemented practice of continued microbial community transfer from pre-existing systems might promote or impede productivity of aquaponics. Specifically, we monitored plant growth phenotypes, water chemistry, and microbiome composition of rhizospheres, biofilters, and fish feces over 61-days of lettuce (               Lactuca sativa var               .               crispa)               growth in nitrogen-limited aquaponic systems inoculated with bacteria that were either commercially sourced or originating from a pre-existing aquaponic system. Lettuce above- and below-ground growth were significantly reduced across replicates treated with a pre-existing aquaponic system inoculum when compared to replicates treated with a commercial inoculum. Reduced productivity was associated with enrichment in specific bacterial genera in plant roots, including               Pseudomonas               , following inoculum transfer from pre-existing systems. Increased productivity was associated with enrichment of nitrogen-fixing               Rahnella               in roots of plants treated with the commercial inoculum. Thus, we show that inoculation from a pre-existing system, rather than from a commercial inoculum, is associated with lower yields. Further work will be necessary to test the putative mechanisms involved.},

Apart from Russia, first promising experiments on sturgeon culture have been carried out in several European countries (Germany, Hungary, France) and Japan as well as the U.S.A. Yet, in the field of bester sturgeon nutrition many authors consider that further investigation is desirable. In this context, the present experiment has as main goal the evaluation of bester capability for nutrients utilization and feed conversion under different feeding rates and environmental conditions. The trails were conducted in an experimental recirculating system and an aquaponic system in different development stages. For both experiments “Troco supreme” fodder with 46\% protein content was used. The feeding efficiency was assessed through technological indicators. The fish condition (allometric factor) and growth performance was assessed for both rearing systems: standard RAS and aquaponic RAS.},

In this case for ensuring food security, innovative technologies like vertical indoor farming through vermiponics and aquaponics can be an alternative option for urban farming. The present study highlights the evaluation of growth and biochemical characteristics of a green vegetable, Amaranthus viridis L. in different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100\%) of cattle dung derived vermiwash (vermiponics) and aquarium water (aquaponics) with tap water as a control. The growth indices such as shoot length, root weight, shoot weight, number of primary and secondary roots, the total number of leaves, leaf area, and wet weight of A. viridis were significantly higher in 100\% vermiponics (P{$<$}0.05). A maximum of 1.96 mg/g protein and 0.98 mg/g carbohydrates was recorded in 100\% vermiwash treatment. Vermiwash showed significantly higher nutrients than aquarium water, which probably influenced the growth and biochemical indices of A. viridis. Conclusively, the integration of vermitechnology with hydroponics technology in vertical indoor farming can be a suitable and sustainable alternative for the futuristic urban farming methods.},

This trial model observed the effects of different stocking biomass on the growth rate of Colossoma macropomum and yield of two L. sativa varieties. A factorial design consisting of three fish density treatments in quadruplicate and two Lettuces variety was used. Nine hundred and sixty fingerlings with 8.35\,±\,0.91 g were stocked at three stocking biomass treatments in quadruplicate: 40 fingerlings or 334 g ­m−3; 80 fingerlings 668 g ­m−3; 120 fingerlings or 1002 g ­m−3. Delice American Lettuce and Purple Crested Lettuce were cultured in the semi-dry wetlands. The final mass (g), consumed food, feed conversion ratio, and yield of fingerling were statistically different between the tested densities, but survival did not. The artificial semi-dry wetlands were efficient on water treatment and the recovery of nutrients in all fish densities trials, and it has potential as support for lettuce production. The recovery of nutrients was shown on the increment of the number of leaves, total fresh mass (g), and lettuces yield by area (kg ­m−2) in both varieties of plants tested. Precocious flowering in 30\% of lettuce varieties, incidence of mealybug and whitefly, temperature and deficiency of calcium and magnesium were factors that may have compromised the full lettuce development. The aquaponics system efficiently treated the fish effluent at the densities tested, being appropriate for fish farming and lettuces production.},

  abstract = {With the pressure to transition towards a fully renewable energy system increasing, a new type of power system architecture is emerging: the microgrid. A microgrid integrates a multitude of decentralised renewable energy technologies using smart energy management systems, in order to efficiently balance the local production and consumption of renewable energy, resulting in a high degree of flexibility and resilience. Generally, the performance of a microgrid increases with the number of technologies present, although it remains difficult to create a fully autonomous microgrid within economic reason (de Graaf F, New strategies for smart integrated decentralised energy systems, 2018). In order to improve the selfsufficiency and flexibility of these microgrids, this research proposes integrating a neighbourhood microgrid with an urban agriculture facility that houses a decoupled multi-loop aquaponics facility. This new concept is called Smarthood, where all Food–Water–Energy flows are circularly connected. In doing so, the performance of the microgrid greatly improves, due to the high flexibility present within the thermal mass, pumps and lighting systems. As a result, it is possible to achieve 95.38\% power and 100\% heat self-sufficiency. This result is promising, as it could pave the way towards realising these fully circular, decentralised Food–Water–Energy systems.},

  abstract = {Recirculating aquaculture systems, as part of aquaponic units, are effective in producing aquatic animals with a minimal water consumption through effective treatment stages. Nevertheless, the concentrated sludge produced after the solid filtration stage, comprising organic matter and valuable nutrients, is most often discarded. One of the latest developments in aquaponic technology aims to reduce this potential negative environmental impact and to increase the nutrient recycling by treating the sludge on-site. For this purpose, microbial aerobic and anaerobic treatments, dealt with either individually or in a combined approach, provide very promising opportunities to simultaneously reduce the organic waste as well as to recover valuable nutrients such as phosphorus. Anaerobic sludge treatments additionally offer the possibility of energy production since a by-product of this process is biogas, i.e. mainly methane. By applying these additional treatment steps in aquaponic units, the water and nutrient recycling efficiency is improved and the dependency on external fertiliser can be reduced, thereby enhancing the sustainability of the system in terms of resource utilisation. Overall, this can pave the way for the economic improvement of aquaponic systems because costs for waste disposal and fertiliser acquisition are decreased.},

RAS wastewater is complemented with macroand micronutrients to obtain equivalent concentrations and pH as in standard hydroponic nutrient solutions (NS). Unlike in single recirculating aquaponic systems, optimal growth conditions can be established in each production part of a DAPS (i.e. fish and plant parts) avoiding compromises. DAPS design seems more adapted for commercial farming operations but feasibility studies on large-scale systems are lacking. Therefore, the production of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L., cv. Foundation) grown in a NS based on complemented pikeperch RAS wastewater (i.e. AP treatment) has been compared to that of tomatoes grown in conventional hydroponic NS (i.e. HP treatment), in semi-practice conditions. During 3 consecutive years, tomatoes were grown on rockwool slabs, in a large-scale Venlo-type climate-controlled greenhouse, using a recirculated drip irrigation system identical to the ones used by the professionals of the hydroponic tomato sector.},

  abstract = {Plant growth performance is optimized under hydroponic conditions. The comparison between aquaponics and hydroponics has attracted considerable attention recently, particularly regarding plant yield. However, previous research has not focused on the potential of using aquaponic solution complemented with mineral elements to commercial hydroponic levels in order to increase yield. For this purpose, lettuce plants were put into AeroFlo installations and exposed to hydroponic (HP), aquaponic (AP), or complemented aquaponic (CAP) solutions. The principal finding of this research was that AP and HP treatments exhibited similar (p {$>$} 0.05) plant growth, whereas the shoot weight of the CAP treatment showed a significant (p {$<$} 0.05) growth rate increase of 39\% on average compared to the HP and AP treatments. Additionally, the root weight was similar (p {$>$} 0.05) in AP and CAP treatments, and both were significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.05) than that observed in the HP treatment. The results highlight the beneficial effect of recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) water on plant growth. The findings represent a further step toward developing decoupled aquaponic systems (i.e., two- or multi-loops) that have the potential to establish a more productive alternative to hydroponic systems. Microorganisms and dissolved organic matter are suspected to play an important role in RAS water for promoting plant roots and shoots growth.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an integrated farming concept that combines fish and hydroponic plant production in a recirculating water system. This food production system promises a reduced environmental footprint when compared to conventional farming systems. However, questions regarding its sustainability remain and there is a lack of data on its performance. A small-scale aquaponic system named PAFF Box (Plant And Fish Farming Box) consisting of a ship container topped by a greenhouse was studied. Plant yield in ebb-and-flow and deep water culture (DWC) hydroponic beds, lettuce, basil and tilapia production capacity and water and energy consumption were investigated. Additionally, all macro- and micronutrient mass balances were analyzed in order to give a better picture of their dynamics and recycling ability. Thanks to the daily inputs of tap water, and 42 g of feed per m2of plant beds, DWC beds showed 3–10 fold higher plant yields than ebb and flow. The production of 1 kg of vegetable in DWC consumed 244 L of water and 84.5 kWh of electricity and 1 kg increase of tilapia consumed 278 L and 96.2 kWh. The system was very efficient in water use for fish production but alternative solutions for warming the water and fine-tuned pumping setup are required to decrease energy needs. Key nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus, iron, copper, zinc, manganese and molybdenum, remained low in solution. Nitrate, calcium, boron and sodium concentrations increased quickly and only water exchange could control their accumulation meanwhile a low daily water exchange rate of 3.6\% implicated a high nutrient loss in the environment. In the willingness to decrease aquaponics environmental footprint, this study indicates that improved designs could be explored such as decoupled aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an integrated farming concept that combines fish and hydroponic plant production in a  recirculating water system. This innovative technique has the potential to reduce the impact of fish  and plant production on the environment by namely closing the nutrient loop. Indeed, the nutrients  leaving the fish part are used to grow hydroponic plants.   This thesis focused on the mineral elements available in aquaponics to grow plants. The thesis  started by deepening the aquaponic concept. It was identified that the mineral elements available for  plants growth in solution were lower concentrated than in hydroponics. It was assumed that an  important parts of the nutrients input were unavailable and lost out of the aquaponic system via  sludge spillage. This leaded to the necessity to determine the consistency of the plant growth and the  proportion of mineral elements that were recycled in aquaponic systems. A solution to improve the  recycling of these elements and increase their availability was also studied. Therefore, the  performances of a one loop aquaponic system named the plant and fish farming box (PAFF Box), in  terms of yields of fish and plant, energy and water consumption, and mineral elements mass  balances were studied. The mineral nutritive elements were also characterised. For experimentation  convenience, lettuce was taken as a model plant. To determine if aquaponics can assure consistent  plant growth compared to conventional systems, lettuce growth has been compared between a one  loop aquaponic solution, a hydroponic solution and a complemented aquaponic solution in deep  water systems in controlled conditions. The latest allowed studying also the growth when nutrient  concentrations are increased in the aquaponic solution. The potential of improvement of nutrient  recycling for increasing their availability to plant by sludge digestion onsite was studied. Therefore,  the mineralisation performance of sludge has been explored in simple aerobic and anaerobic  reactors and in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB).   In the term of this work, it appeared that aquaponics consumed and discharged less water to  produce fish and plant but required more energy than conventional farming systems. The lettuce  showed similar growth performance between aquaponic and hydroponic solution but significantly  higher growth (i.e. 39\% fresh mass increase) in complemented aquaponic solution. This indicated  that lower mineral elements concentrations did not impact negatively plant growth and that an  increase of concentrations improved growth compared to conventional hydroponics. Also the  microorganisms and dissolved organic matter may play an important role for promoting plant roots  and shoots growth in aquaponics. Mineral elements mass balances analysis showed that an  important part of the elements were accumulating in sludge and lost by water and sludge spillage.  However, the sludge digestion onsite showed promising results to recover these elements in  available form for plants. It would allow reducing environmental footprints by limiting the nutrients  loss and recycle even more water. Regarding these results an improvement of the one loop  aquaponic system was suggested as a hybrid decoupled aquaponic system that would limit water and  nutrients discharge and improve plant growth.},

  abstract = {Research on the use of Biofloc Technology (BFT) in Flood \& Drain (F\&D) Aquaponic Systems has been carried out, to improve water quality parameters (pH, temperature, DO, COD, and BOD. In this system used Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Samhong Mustard (Brassica juncea L). This system consists of Fish Pond Tank (FPT), Mechanical Filter Tank (MFT), Biological Filter Tank (BFT), Storage Tank (ST), and Hydroponic Plant Circuits (HPC), and supported by a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) and aeration to supply oxygen. Based on research conducted, obtained pH (7.7–8.7), tem­ perature (25–30)°C, DO (5.5–7.7)mg/L, COD (9.638–25.9493)mg/L, BOD (0.4816–4.6408)mg/L. The results of this study were compared with Indonesian Government Regulations No.82 of 2001) and com­ promised water quality (Sommerville et al., 2014; Sallenave, 2016; Anonymous 2014). The results were pH, temperature, DO, COD, and BOD did not exceed the quality standard limits. Optimal water quality in this BFT system greatly supports the growth and survival of fish, plants, and bacteria, so the application of biofloc in an F\&D aquaponic system needs to be done.},

  abstract = {Indonesia is currently faced with a variety of problems, including relating to increasing food demand and prices, increasingly scarce clean water, and poverty. Therefore, the development of aquaponics technology has been carried out, which integrates aquaculture and hydroponics. This study was conducted to compare water quality (pH, temperature, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate) produced from 2 different systems, namely aquaponic with modified conventional aquaculture systems. In an aquaponic system, water recirculation follows the steps: Water from a fish pond tank (FPT), flows to mechanical tanks-1(MT-1), biofilter tanks (BT), mechanical tanks-2 (MT-2), to hydroponic plants (HP), and finally back to FPT, and so on. While conventional aquaculture systems, water recirculation is only through FPT, MT, and BT. The results were obtained for aquaponic (ammonia 0.350-5.946 mg/L, nitrite 0.193-0.880 mg/L and nitrate 1.031-5.542 mg/L), and for modified conventional aquaculture systems (ammonia 0.350-9.353 mg/L, nitrite 0.114-0.880 mg/L and nitrate 0.949-1.031 mg/L). While the pH and temperature values for the two systems are the same, pH 7.18-8.9, and water temperature 26.7- 30.0°C. After the ttest, both showed a significant difference where the aquaponics system was better than the modified conventional aquaculture system because the aquaponic system was supported by the presence of MT-1, BT, MT-2, HP, and FPT, while the modified conventional aquaculture systems were only supported by MT, BT, and FPT.},

  abstract = {With the recent advances in the field of alternate agriculture, there has been an ever-growing demand for aquaponics as a potential substitute for traditional agricultural techniques for improving sustainable food production. However, the lack of data-driven methods and approaches for aquaponic cultivation remains a challenge. The objective of this research is to investigate statistical methods to make inferences using small datasets for nutrient control in aquaponics to optimize yield. In this work, we employed the Density-Based Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (DB-SMOTE) to address dataset imbalance, and ExtraTreesClassifer and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to choose the relevant features. Synthetic data generation techniques such as the Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling techniques were used to generate enough data points and different feature engineering techniques were used on the predictors before evaluating the performance of kernel-based classifiers with the goal of controlling nutrients in the aquaponic solution for optimal growth.[27–35]},

  abstract = {Catfish farming has long been carried out by local farmers with various systems and technologies. A reduction of land and water availability in urban aquaculture has been stimulate the application of aquaponic and biofloc technology. In this study, we aimed to analyze production performance, financial feasibility, and sensitivity analysis in catfish farming through a different farm system including water exchange system, aquaponic and biofloc technology. A case study was used from catfish (Clarias gariepinus) farmers in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. The production performance analyzed is the total production, productivity and survival. Financial feasibility analysis used cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and sensitivity analysis is carried out on changes in the amount of production based on the survival value. The results showed that the best productivity of catfish was obtained from a water exchange system with a production value of 4038.0 ± 6.0 kg, productivity 168.0 ± 2.0 kg per m2, and the survival of 79.4 ± 2.2\%. The financial feasibility analysis suggested that the water exchange system was US\$ 4204.29 (NPV), 12.52 (BCR), and 301.82\% (IRR), in the aquaponic was US\$ 5048.3 6 (NPV), 12.57 (BCR) and 303.48\% (IRR) and for biofloc technology was US\$ 2242.23 (NPV), 7.67 (BCR), and 184.07\% (IRR), analysis period was five years. The sensitivity analysis shows that the limit of reduction in survival value in water exchange catfish culture, aquaponic, and biofloc technology are 64.0\%, 60.0\% and 64.0\% respectively. Our study showed that the production and financial performance of catfish farming using biofloc technology produces the lowest value compared to the other two systems. It was found that the farmers have not implemented the biofloc technology procedures correctly and have not routinely monitored water quality in all systems and technologies. Still, we were able to acknowledge this issue in hope that we can fix it in the future.},

  abstract = {Designing an aquaponic system is based on guidelines found in literature. However, it is uncertain whether these guidelines are optimal in the case of a multi-loop decoupled aquaponic system (DAPS) with an anaerobic digester. The objective of this study was to build and analyze a model of a multi-loop DAPS with digester, and use it to review system performance in terms of sustainability criteria. In particular, the computer-aided case study of a multi-loop DAPS in Nairobi (Kenya) was performed to evaluate the design, in terms of water and nutrient use efficiencies and energy consumption. Furthermore, the model was used to perform a sensitivity analysis, and to perform further optimization of the design. The findings of a modelbased design clearly indicate that aquaponic system design guidelines, as found in literature, do not necessarily lead to an optimal system design of a multi-loop DAPS with digester. The main reason for this deviation is the presence of a digester in the multi-loop DAPS. Moreover, the results showed that nutrient concentration ranges have a large impact on the performance of any aquaponic system, in terms of sustainability, since these ranges determine when dilution or supplementing of the nutrient solution is needed. Optimization of the system design resulted in a nutrient use efficiency (NUE) of nitrogen of 77.74\%, a NUE of phosphorus of 95.09\%, a water use efficiency of 99.74\%, and a feeding rate ratio of 5.19 g m−2 day−1.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is currently a significant contributor to the Sri Lankan economy, but there is still a lack of integration of modern technology with agriculture. Over the past few decades, many people are moving away from agricultural occupations due to urbanization. As a result, the higher portion of the food items in the urban areas has to be transported from distant agrarian lands. This has led to creating several issues such as food getting damage by transportation, quality reduction, and the increment of food wastage. As a consequence, customers are experiencing high food prices. Moreover, using water for agriculture has become a widely concerning matter worldwide, especially in urbanized areas. To overcome the emerged problems, Aquaponic systems for urban cultivation can be introduced. Aquaponics is an innovative and sustainable production system and plays a critical role in the environmental and socio-economic sustainability of the agricultural sector. Aquaponics system can be producing healthy local, fresh food products with a short supply chain in terms of a pesticide-free environment. This will be the best solution for highly urbanized areas, and it is already successful in many parts of the world. Therefore, this article mainly focuses on introducing an eco-friendly aquaponic system design for highly urbanized areas in Sri Lanka.},

BFT brown (formed with no direct natural light and bacterial dominance) and green (exposed to direct natural light, algal system) waters can be potentially used for aquaponics of commercial halophytes. This study evaluated changes in physical-chemical parameters and macronutrient concentrations of brown and green saline waters of BFT systems, with marine shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) breeding stock, subjected to a one-week recirculation cycle in saline aquaponics with halophytes (Salicornia neei, Apium graveolens and Paspalum vaginatum). For 30 days in the summer of 2019, clarified brown and green waters of BFT systems of L. vannamei were used for aquaponic cultivation of these three halophytes. Water samples were collected before and after one week of water recirculation in the aquaponic systems. Halophytes grow well with both water types. The brown water had a higher phosphate concentration and its nitrate content reduced 3-fold in magnitude after one week of recirculation. The green water had higher average concentrations of nitrate, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfate compared to the brown water, and its nitrate and nitrite contents significantly increased after one week of recirculation. The remediation of dissolved macronutrients using aquaponics can be ineffective for green water types, mainly due to the death and decay of photoautotrophic microorganisms during the water recirculation process inside aquaponic structures.},

  abstract = {Saline aquaponics is a fast-growing research field, although little attention has been paid to micronutrients in water from aquaculture and their nutritional potential to sustain commercial vegetable production. This study evaluated the effects of micronutrient supplementation, direct in the water and by foliar spraying, against a no nutrient addition control, on growth and biomass production of the Brazilian halophytes Salicornia neei Lag., Apium graveolens L. and Paspalum vaginatum Sw., using saline aquaponics with one-year-old BFT system water from breeding stock tanks of the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Plants were established in hydroponic units and clarified saline water from a BFT system was recirculated and replaced weekly over 30 days. Micronutrient addition in the water significantly increased the concentrations of iron, manganese and molybdenum, but water quality parameters and macronutrients were not modified. Micronutrient addition in the water increased P. vaginatum growth (shoot height and leaf number) and biomass production 20–30\% compared to non-supplemented plants, showing the high micronutritional requirement of this species, most likely for iron. Salicornia neei plants showed no benefits when grown with the extra supply of micronutrients in the water, but a 73\% reduction of shoot biomass occurred using foliar fertilization compared to the control treatment. Due to the poor development of A. graveolens plants, the response of this species to micronutrient additions could not be evaluated. Overall, clarified BFT system water can supply micronutritional requirements for halophytes, but supplementation may be necessary for species that have high demands and/or are more sensitive to the neutral-alkaline condition of marine aquaculture (e.g., impairment of Fe availability), such as P. vaginatum. Foliar spraying was not effective at improving halophyte growth, and caution should be taken when reusing water supplemented with micronutrients after it leaves an aquaponics system, due to the lack of knowledge about the toxicity of these added elements to animals.},

  abstract = {The culture of Seriola species is well established in Japan and is an emerging industry in many other temperate regions around the world. Despite many studies on the growth, physiology and nutritional requirements of yellowtail kingfish, the complex interactions between nutrition and environmental impacts are still being in­ vestigated. Here, we present a theoretical bioenergetic model for yellowtail kingfish bringing together the current knowledge of this species growth, metabolism and other aspects of its physiology. We solve the energy budget of yellowtail kingfish using existing theoretical equations to represent all energy gains and all metabolic costs and parameterising them with published data obtained when rearing yellowtail kingfish. Our model pre­ dicts growth as a function of suitable temperatures for yellowtail kingfish (18–27 °C) and estimates the rate of feed ingestion as well as the effect of diet on feed conversion ratio (FCR). Our model can be used to estimate energy and protein retention, nutrients loads into the ecosystem, and how these outputs change through diet manipulation at specified weight classes. We demonstrate how to use our model to predict improvements to FCR and include a simulation example showing results from shifting from a high protein-low fat diet for juveniles (0 to 500 g) to a low protein-high fat diet for adult fish (500–1000 g). Excretion of dissolved nitrogen and the consumption of oxygen through fish respiration are highest at the optimum temperature for growth. When fed a diet of 45\% protein and 20\% fat, our simulation shows that a constant biomass of 1000 kg of fish at a constant optimum temperature of 22.8 °C, excretes 153.1 kg of nitrogen year -1. For the same diet composition and temperature, oxygen consumption decreases from 19.9 to 10.2 kg day−1 for 1000 kg of fish weighing 50 g and 1.5 kg, respectively. Our model is useful to investigate complex interactions of metabolism for the culture of yellowtail kingfish in a commercial setting and allows predictions for changes that could improve production.},

Although aquaponics has not been included in this guideline, it is worth investigating to establish a baseline for facilities to reference in produce production. Two microbial assays were performed, one a decoupled media-based aqua­ ponics system over one year and another on a decoupled nutrient film technique (NFT) aquaponics system over 16 days. Water was sampled from each system over time to analyze changes of E. coli and coliforms. The geo­ metric mean (GM) and statistical threshold variable (STV) were calculated based on E. coli populations from the irrigation source in each system. From the first experiment, it was determined, based on the FDA Produce Safety Rule, that E. coli must be monitored more closely from June to January as they were above the advised limit. The second experiment determined that E. coli and coliforms in the water significantly decreased over 16 days. Water should be held for 8 d and up to 16 d to reduce the likelihood of foodborne pathogens to contaminate produce.},

This paper builds on Garnett’s contribution by considering how high levels of food waste contribute to the food chain’s greenhouse emissions and how they can be reduced, something Garnett generally overlooks. The emissions that arise from food waste represent the emissions embedded in the production of food that is then wasted and the emissions that arise from the process of waste disposal. Food waste can also be split into pre-consumer and consumer waste. These distinctions give rise to four categories of food waste related emissions: pre-consumer embedded, pre-consumer waste disposal, consumer embedded and consumer waste disposal emissions. The levels of food waste in each category differ between economies, as do the causes of wastage. Policies to address food waste and the associated emissions need to promote a mixture of technological and behavioural change and be tailored to the economic, cultural and technological conditions in each country.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture is fast-growing industry because of major increases in for fish and seafood demands all over the world. Aquaponic system is re-circulating aquaculture system that integrates hydroponic production of plants. The aquaponic system was comprised of 139.59 liters of fish tank. The fishes were stocked at the rate of 20 Tilapia fingerlings. Water from the fish tank was flooded to the media bed (cocopeat) and then drained back in the sump tank. Vermicompost were converted from the organic waste using the non-burrowing earthworms, Eudrilus eugeniae. This system was analyzed by physical and nutritional parameters of aquaponic water, vermicompost and seaweed, Turbinaria conoides along with the estimates of morphological efficiency of herbal greens, Solanum nigrum. T. conoides seaweed was used to resolution the nutrient deficiency in the aquaponic water. The nutrient level in the aquaponic water and vermicompost were recorded as NO₃ (35 mg/l and 1.49mg/l), phosphate (10 mg/l: 17 mg/l), and potassium (27 mg/l: 287 mg/l), respectively. Calcium and Magnesium level in the aquaponic water and vermicompost were recorded as 34 mg/l and 14.2 mg/l, 49 mg/l and18 mg/l, respectively. The Iron and Zinc level in the aquaponic water and vermicompost were recorded as 0.2mg/l and 1.3 mg/l and 0.08 mg/l, and 0.18 mg/l, respectively. Plant height the total number of leaf area were highest in T3 on the 7th week and compare the T6 and lowest in the control T1.Fresh weight and dry weight of the trial were highest in T3 (92.40) followed by T6 (88.10) and least in T1 (78.70). The root: shoot ratio were highest at T3 (0.12) and compare the T6 (0.15) and least at T2 (0.22), T1 (0.26). The study reported that the higher growths were observed in the aquaponic water because continuous supply of nutrients to the plants along with the T.conoides seaweed extract has different effects on the growth of S. nigrum. Hence, in this present study is the simple practice of application of aquaponic water using seaweed as liquid fertilizers and were eco-friendly approaches is recommended to the farmers for attaining better growth and yield.},

  abstract = {The goal of this project, one of the proposals of the EPS@ISEP Spring 2014, was to develop an Aquaponics System. Over recent years Aquaponics systems have received increased attention since they contribute to reduce the strain on resources within 1st and 3rd world countries. Aquaponics is the combination of Hydroponics and Aquaculture, mimicking a natural environment in order to successfully apply and enhance the understanding of natural cycles within an indoor process. Using this knowledge of natural cycles, it was possible to create a system with capabilities similar to that of a natural environment with the support of electronics, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. The multinational team involved in the development of this system was composed of five students from five countries and fields of study. This paper describes their solution, including the overall design, the technology involved and the benefits it can bring to the current market. The team was able to design and render the Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings of the prototype, assemble all components, successfully test the electronics and comply with the budget. Furthermore, the designed solution was supported by a product sustainability study and included a specific marketing plan. Last but not least, the students enrolled in this project obtained new multidisciplinary knowledge and increased their team work and cross-cultural communication skills.},

  abstract = {In aquaponic systems, the residual water from the cultivation of fish is not enough to meet the nutritional demands of plants. The main objective of this study was to investigate how to adjust a nutritive solution for the cultivation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in aquaponics, based on hydroponics. The treatments included six separate crops of lettuce in an aquaponic system, while the hydroponic system served as the control. In each treatment, three blocks were used to quantify the parameters of ‘head’ diameter, number and dry weight of leaves, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, total dry weight, and the concentration and accumulation of nutrients in the total dry weight of the lettuce plants. The lower nutrient supply led to the occurrence of the lowest total dry weight in the C2 leaf crops when compared to that of the other crops of aquaponics, which had adequate time for system maturation. The system maturation and the use of a balanced solution in the C5 and C6 crops allowed the head diameter of the aquaponics plants to be equal to those of the hydroponics plants. In the aquaponic system, N and Fe were the most limiting macronutrient and micronutrient, respectively. To produce lettuce in an aquaponic system, it is necessary to ‘ripen’ the crop water for at least 30 days, and supplement micronutrients in the form of mineral fertiliser.},

  abstract = {Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is an aquaculture commodity which has high production and tendency to be cultured in intensive culturing system. However, the latter can accumulate high amount of organic waste (leftover feed and fish feces) which will cause poor water quality by increasing total suspended solid (TSS) level and ammonia level as well. The solution to the prior problem is by using the aquaponic system with the addition of Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas bacteria in the probiotic application. Still, the effective probiotic dosage is yet to discover, so that this study aims to figure out the effective dosage of the probiotic to decrease TSS and ammonia level. This study used RAL as research design with 5 treatments repeated 4 times: control (no addition of probiotic), 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 1.5 mg/L, and 2 mg/L. The result shows that 1.5 mg/L is the most effective dosage which can decrease TSS and ammonia level into 16.18 ± 0.0571 mg/L and 0.178 ± 0.0673 mg/L respectively.},

  abstract = {In intensive aquaculture systems, ammonia–nitrogen buildup from the metabolism of feed is usually the second limiting factor to increase production levels after dissolved oxygen. The three nitrogen conversion pathways traditionally used for the removal of ammonia–nitrogen in aquaculture systems are photoautotrophic removal by algae, autotrophic bacterial conversion of ammonia–nitrogen to nitrate–nitrogen, and heterotrophic bacterial conversion of ammonia–nitrogen directly to microbial biomass. Traditionally, pond aquaculture has used photoautotrophic algae based systems to control inorganic nitrogen buildup. Currently, the primary strategy in intensive recirculating production systems for controlling ammonia–nitrogen is using large fixed-cell bioreactors. This option utilizes chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria, Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) and Nitrite Oxidizing Bacteria (NOB), for the nitrification of ammonia–nitrogen to nitrite–nitrogen and finally to nitrate–nitrogen. In the past several years, zero-exchange management systems have been developed that are based on heterotrophic bacteria and have been promoted for the intensive production of marine shrimp. In this third pathway, heterotrophic bacterial growth is stimulated through the addition of organic carbonaceous substrate. At high carbon to nitrogen (C/N) feed ratios, heterotrophic bacteria will assimilate ammonia–nitrogen directly into cellular protein. This paper reviews these three ammonia removal pathways, develops a set of stoichiometric balanced relationships using half-reaction relationships, and discusses their impact on water quality. In addition, microbial growth fundamentals are used to characterize production of volatile and total suspended solids for autotrophic and heterotrophic systems.},

In order to better understand the role of microorganisms in this tripartite relationship, we studied the bacterial communities hosted in eight aquaponic and aquaculture systems. The bacterial communities were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing. At the phylum level, the bacterial communities from all systems were relatively similar with a predominance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, however, the communities present in the sampled systems were more heterogeneous. The biofilter samples harbored more diverse communities than the corresponding sump samples. The core microbiomes from the coupled and decoupled systems shared more common operational taxonomic units than with the aquaculture systems. Eventually, some of the taxa identified in the systems could have beneficial functions for plant growth and health, but a deeper analysis would be required to identify the precise functions involved in aquaponics.},

A substantial part of the feed is ingested by the fish and either used for growth and metabolism or excreted as soluble and solid faeces, while the rest of any uneaten feed decays in the tanks. While the soluble excretions are readily available for the plants, the solid faeces need to be mineralised by microorganisms in order for its nutrient content to be available for plant uptake. It is thus more challenging to control the available nutrient concentrations in aquaponics than in hydroponics. Furthermore, many factors, amongst others pH, temperature and light intensity, influence the nutrient availability and plant uptake. Until today, most studies have focused on the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. However, to ensure good crop yields, it is necessary to provide the plants with sufficient levels of all key nutrients. It is therefore essential to better understand and control nutrient cycles in aquaponics.},

  author = {Eck, Mathilde},

  abstract = {In 2030, the world’s population should reach 8.3 billion people and 60\% of them should live in urban areas. It is thus necessary to develop intensive yet sustainable urban production systems in order to increase cities’ resilience. Aquaponics is defined as a combination of hydroponic and aquaculture techniques and seems to be a promising technology to meet this resilience. It functions with plants, fish and microorganisms which play a key role in nitrification and mineralisation of fish wastes into nutrients absorbable by plants. Herein we aim at characterising the bacteria present in diversified systems to better understand the composition and role of their communities in aquaponics. To this end, nine diversified aquaponic systems were sampled. The DNA from each bacteria community was extracted and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq technology by targeting the V1-V3 16S rDNA region. The sequences were then analysed with the QIIME bioinformatic software. Results show that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes are the dominant phyla for all the aquaponic systems. Depending on each system, different proportions of other phyla are also present among the bacterial community. The genera which compose all the identified phyla are more diverse and an important proportion of them are usually found in soils and rhizosphere. One of the roles that could be linked to these genera is the breaking down of complex organic compounds which could be related to the mineralisation phenomenon observed in aquaponic systems. Further studies should be undertaken to identify the exact species present in aquaponic systems and to understand their specific functions.},

@thesis{EconomicAnalysisAquaponics,
  title = {Economic {{Analysis Of Aquaponics Production In Indiana}}},
  abstract = {This paper presented an economic analysis of aquaponics production in two different ways.  First, we did a comparison between an aquaponics system and a hydroponics system. Second,  we constructed three scenarios for representative farms to analyze price and investment  sensibility.   In the first analysis, we found that the aquaponics system needs higher investment  and operating cost and also has lower production of vegetables compared with the  hydroponics system in a 10-year project. Using the same output prices for both systems, the  hydroponics system is more economically viable with a NPV of \$80,226 vs. \$29,976 for  aquaponics. However, aquaponics production of vegetables can be managed as organic  production. Organic products have higher prices in the market and this may make the  aquaponics system become more economically viable. If organic vegetables prices are  18.40\% greater than non-organic prices, the aquaponics becomes profitable. The feasibility  of these prices depends on many factors such as region, quantity produced, seasonality, type  of vegetables, etc. In some regions, organic prices are about twice the non-organic prices.   For the second analysis, the production of basil provides better economic results than  the fish. All farm sizes are profitable when basil price is \$4.50. If basil price is lower, all  scenarios are not profitable. For a profitable investment, the small famer should aim at  receiving as least \$4.50 for basil and \$2.00 for tilapia, otherwise total investment costs will  be more than 66\% of his annual operating cost. A higher initial investment would require  higher prices to have economic feasibility.},

Excessive amount of phosphorus content will cause nutrient enrichment and decrease oxygen. As the result, it may impact the farmed fish. Aquaponic system can be a solution to the problem, because the plants in the aquaponic system can absorb and utilize the phosphate for the plant growth. This study aims to determine the rate of phosphate absorption through aquaponic system and determine the maximum number of kale plants that works best in absorbing phosphate. This study was conducted from July to September, 2013. It was held at the laboratory in Aquaculture Department of Agriculture Faculty, University of Lampung. This study used Complete Randomized Design with four treatments (control, 10 stems/clump, 20 stems/clump, and 30 stems/clump) and three repetitions. The result showed significant effect on the level of α = 0.05. This means that the treatment has an effect on the absorption of orthophosphate. Rate of highest phospate absorption is 0,000387 mg/L on in 24 hour. The treatment that shows the most significant influence in decreasing the concentration of orthophosphate is the one with 30 stems/clump.},

To date vetiver grass is planted in soil and hydroponic media with additional nutrients. Objective: This study aimed to find out whether vetiver grass is able to grow in aquaponic system and suitable to be planted concurrently with fish. The present study is interesting because such topic has never studied before. Result: Nile tilapia fish was used and experiments were carried out using Recirculating Aquaponic System (RAS) for six weeks where the observations and measurements of which were done every week. The result indicated that Nile tilapia planted concurrently with vetiver grass in higher density (P2) has the best Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR). There was no significant difference between the growth of vetiver grass P1 and P2, the grass was able to grow with RGR of 0.01 g day-1. The percentage of N and P in vetiver grass tissue reached 1.98\% and 0.35\%, respectively. Such percentage is considered very sufficient and it showed that the nutrient was wellabsorbed. Conclusion: Nile tilapia and vetiver grass are potential to be cultivated in the same system and so the system is very potential to be developed.},

  abstract = {Leafy greens eaten raw as salads are minimally processed and widely consumed foods. Risk factors for leafy greens contamination by Salmonella spp. and Norovirus were considered in the context of the whole food chain including agricultural production and processing. Available estimates of the prevalence of these pathogens (together with the use of Escherichia coli as an indicator organism) in leafy greens were evaluated. Specific mitigation options relating to contamination of leafy greens were considered and qualitatively assessed. It was concluded that each farm environment represents a unique combination of numerous characteristics that can influence occurrence and persistence of pathogens in leafy greens production. Appropriate implementation of food safety management systems, including Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), should be primary objectives of leafy green producers. The relevance of microbiological criteria applicable to production, processing and at retail/catering were considered. The current legal framework does not include microbiological criteria applicable at primary production which will validate and verify GAP and GHP. It is proposed to define a criterion at primary production of leafy greens which is designated as Hygiene Criterion, and E. coli was identified as suitable for this purpose. A Process Hygiene Criterion for E. coli in leafy green packaging plants or fresh cutting plants was considered and will also give an indication of the degree to which GAP, GHP, GMP or HACCP programs have been implemented. A Food Safety Criterion for Salmonella in leafy greens could be used as a tool to communicate to producers and processors that Salmonella should not be present in the product. Studies on the prevalence and infectivity of Norovirus are limited, and quantitative data on viral load are scarce making establishment of microbiological criteria for Norovirus on leafy greens difficult.},

We used local fish and plants species only. The project was conducted in two different stages: "construction" stage and "fish" stage. The goal of the start-up stage was to build the grow bed for the plants, to establish the water circuit, to set the lights and to prepare the fish tank for the fishes. For the "fish" stage we used local fish species (carp and caras). The goal of the stage was to build the nitrogen-fixing bacteria colonies in order to provide a constant NO3í rich water (around 50 mg/l), with as low as possible traces of NH3 / NH4+ and NO2í  (below 0,5 mg/l). This was established by testing the NH3 / NH4+, NO2í and NO3í  values under several environmental changes (pH, temperature, lighting, quantity of fish in the tank etc.) in order to identify the best combinations to achieve the goal. Upon completion of the second stage we'll test different local species of plants with the already established system. The goal of the project is to find the best combinations of fish, plants and environmental conditions in order to have a cheap, sustainable symbiotic food production system, easy to be replicated by anyone.},

  abstract = {Conventional agriculture has been widely used to overcome food scarcity in Egypt, but in turn created new environmental, social, and economic problems. Aquaponics has a huge potential as a sustainable solution since it demonstrates promising results for urban food development while providing new entrepreneurship and start-up opportunities. Although it presents a big opportunity especially for developing countries like Egypt, it still requires further studies and researches to fully overcome foreseen challenges. This study discusses the possibility of implementing aquaponics as an alternative to conventional agriculture in Egypt through a comparison between aquaponics and conventional agriculture. The first section of this investigation analyzes the economic feasibility of aquaponics in terms of capital and operational expenditure costs. Then, an experimental comparative study is carried out examining two pilot-scale aquaponics systems (Deep water Culture system and Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture system), where crop quality (vitamins, heavy metals, and pesticides residues) of the two systems has been compared among each other, as well as to that of the commercially available organic food available in supermarkets. Results indicated that both systems produce high-quality safe organic food. The economic feasibility analysis indicated that Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture System is producing more crops with a wider variety of almost 20\% less capital expenditure and operational expenditure costs. Fish production for both systems was close, yet slightly higher in Deep Water Culture. Although, on the short term, aquaponics entails relatively high capital and operational expenditure costs compared with conventional agriculture; yet, on the long term, it is more profitable, while saving up to 85\% of the water wasted by conventional farming techniques. Finally, the study discusses the main limitations, drawbacks, and future of aquaponics in Egypt where public awareness and a new mindset are needed to highlight the link between agriculture and sustainability.},

However, the effects of foliar fertilization on shelf life and postharvest quality of the crops are rather under-researched. The aim of this field experiment was to evaluate the effect of foliar application of individual mineral nutrients (calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) on pre and postharvest quality of broccoli. The broccoli plants were subjected to single foliar sprays of either Ca, Fe, Zn, or Mn, which was repeated four times during plant growth at a 1 g/kg concentration. Once harvested, the broccoli heads were refrigerated at 4 ◦C for 28 days. Our results indicated that foliar application of Ca, Zn, Mn, and Fe did not have a significant effect on plant growth parameters, apart from enhancing Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter values. However, during postharvest, foliar application treatment showed a positive response on weight loss during storage and reduction in yellowing of the broccoli heads. Foliar treatments increased the concentration of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Ca, Zn, Mn and Fe significantly in the broccoli head tissue. Total chlorophyll content, total phenolic compound, ascorbic acid, peroxidase activity, glucoraphanin and glucobrassicin and flavonoids were significantly increased by all foliar treatments. Crude protein content and sulforaphane were enhanced by Ca and Mn treatments. Overall, foliar application of the investigated mineral nutrients may prove beneficial in improving the shelf-life and nutrient content of broccoli during postharvest handling and storage.},

Also, Spirulina can be used in many pharmaceutical products and can be used as compost for plant growth, on other hand Spirulina has a great positive impact on the surrounding environment because it consumes carbon dioxide from the air during its photosynthesis processes and produce oxygen. In this paper we established an algae unit adjacent to the aquaponic system inside Heliopolis university campus, by the help of the fresh water that resulted from the RO unit inside the aquaponic system we were able to breed the Spirulina which is a rich source of protein and can be used a source of fish food inside the aquaponics system, the suitable media and the adequate growth condition in the Egyptian environment were investigated, that were done by using three different media and for each media growth rate was observed. We found out that the most suitable medium for Spirulina growth rate in the Egyptian costal environment was Zarrouk medium rather than the other medium. At the end of this study different charts were yielded, a group of recommendations were deduced in order to give reliable guidelines for other researchers.},

In this process, the wastes generated by the fish (such as urine, ammonia and decomposed fish fodder) are converted by nitrifying bacteria into forms readily to be assimilated by plants. The process of building the nitrifying bacteria cultures is known as "cycling". On this process the daily values of temperature, nitrates, nitrites, ammonia and pH in the fish tank water are to be assessed and controlled toward the goal of having the bacteria cultures established as quick as possible. The methodology of choice for the assessment of nitrates, nitrites and ammonia was spectrophotometric determination.},

The study used four treatments, namely A (control), B Kale (Ipomoea aquatica), C Lettuce (Lactuca sativa), and D Pakcoy (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis), with three replications for each treatment. The result showed that different vegetable plants' applications significantly affected (P 0.05) the absolute weight gain, absolute length gain, and survival rate of common carp fingerlings. The highest value obtained was in treatment B (Ipomoea aquatic) with an absolute weight gain of 3.93 ± 0.28 g, absolute length gain of 3.81±0.21 cm, and survival rate of 100±0.0\%, while the lowest was in treatment A (control) with an absolute weight gain of 1.21±0.76 g, absolute length gain of 1.70±0.10 cm and survival rate of 91±0.86\%. Water quality was also collected in this study and the parameters during rearing were still within the tolerance limits of common carp rearing. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Kale plant, Ipomoea aquatica is the most recommended vegetable plant to be co-cultured with common carp in the aquaponics system.Keywords:AquaponicsCommon CarpVegetable Plants},

  abstract = {Objectives\hspace{0.6em} To assess the feasibility of conducting a cost-effectiveness study of using care farms (CFs) to improve quality of life and reduce reoffending among offenders undertaking community orders (COs). To pilot questionnaires to assess quality of life, connection to nature, lifestyle behaviours, health and social-care use. To assess recruitment and retention at 6 months and feasibility of data linkage to Police National Computer (PNC) reconvictions data and data held by probation services. Design\hspace{0.6em} Pilot study using questionnaires to assess quality of life, individually linked to police and probation data. Setting\hspace{0.6em} The pilot study was conducted in three probation service regions in England. Each site included a CF and at least one comparator CO project. CFs are working farms used with a range of clients, including offenders, for therapeutic purposes. The three CFs included one aquaponics and horticulture social enterprise, a religious charity focusing on horticulture and a family-run cattle farm. Comparator projects included sorting secondhand clothes and activities to address alcohol misuse and anger management. Participants\hspace{0.6em} We recruited 134 adults (over 18) serving COs in England, 29\% female. Results\hspace{0.6em} 52\% of participants completed follow-up questionnaires. Privatisation of UK probation trusts in 2014 negatively impacted on recruitment and retention. Linkage to PNC data was a more successful means of follow-up, with 90\% consenting to access their probation and PNC data. Collection of health and social-care costs and quality-adjusted life year derivation were feasible. Propensity score adjustment provided a viable comparison method despite differences between comparators. We found worse health and higher reoffending risk among CF participants due to allocation of challenging offenders to CFs, making risk of reoffending a confounder. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Recruitment would be feasible in a more stable probation environment. Follow-up was challenging; however, assessing reconvictions from PNC data is feasible and a potential primary outcome for future studies.},

  abstract = {There has been a steady increase in the demand for organic and sustainable agricultural products. Consumers increasingly prefer non-GMO products grown without pesticides and antibiotics. In order to satisfy the increasing demand, several agricultural producers have opted for use of different types of modern agricultural practices which are more efficient and sustainable than conventional methods. My research focuses on two such modern agricultural practices. Because the products from these methods do not have many food safety interventions applied to them, it is important to make sure that they are free of pathogens and are safe for human consumption. My research 1) Identifies the food safety hazards associated with an aquaponic food production system and studies the efficacy of UV intervention, and 2) Evaluates the food safety status of the initial phase of an integrated crop-livestock organic agricultural system. Aquaponics is a growing trend in food production as it is seen as a sustainable, space- and energy-efficient approach for production of fruits, vegetables and seafood. Within aquaponics, few microbial studies have been conducted to determine the food safety status of its units. The aim of this study was to determine the food safety status and the effectiveness of ultraviolet treatment (15 watt UV light, luminous flux of 900 lumens) as a food safety intervention in reducing the microbial loads of the water system, in a model aquaponic unit that is growing lettuce, basil and barramundi (Australian Sea Bass). Large Leaf basil, Buttercrunch Bibb lettuce, water and fish swab samples were collected throughout the 118-day production period and microbial analysis was conducted for the presence of E. coli O157:H7, Aeromonas and Salmonella spp. and the prevalence of aerobic plate counts (APC), coliforms, and fecal coliforms in the systems in triplicates. Absence of foodborne pathogens was confirmed using ELISA technology (3M™ Tecra, Australia) and enumeration through petrifilms (coliform/ E. coli Petrifilm™, 3M, St. Paul, MN) and agar (Aeromonas agar, OXOID, Hants, United Kingdom). A significant increase was observed in aerobic plate counts over the trial period (1 to 3 log CFU/mL), in the presence and absence of UV (p\textbackslash textgreater0.05). Ultraviolet treatment did not significantly reduce the APC, Aeromonas or coliform counts when compared to the control systems samples. Though the UV intervention method was not effective in reducing microbial loads, future work should focus on improving the unit design, evaluation of bio-solid filtration and other food safety interventions that can be effective in the presence of living system while maintaining fish homeostatic environment. Though several researchers have indicated the many benefits associated with the production and consumption of organic food such as restricted use of antibiotics and synthetic chemicals; it must be kept in mind that these benefits do not address the issue of microbial safety. With integrated crop-livestock production systems being relatively new practice in organic agriculture, the aim of this study was to develop and use a model agricultural system to check the food safety status of crops and beef and dairy calves (6–10 months old) produced in an integrated environment in Minnesota (MN), Iowa (IA), and Pennsylvania (PA). Pasture and fecal samples were collected 3 months apart and evaluated for presence of E. coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella using miniVIDAS and confirmation tests were performed according to FDA BAM and USDA standards. Results indicated very low probability for (0.0173-IA, 0.0032-MN, 0.0039-PA) E. coli 0157:H7 and (0.0077-IA, 0.0027-MN, 0.0022-PA) Salmonella occurrence (overall Pr\textbackslash textless0.1). The three states were studied individually for occurrence of E. coli 0157:H7 or Salmonella. The probabilities of occurrence were again very low (0.0048-IA, 0.0003-MN, 0.0009-PA). Also, there was no significant difference between the three research sites (p\textbackslash textgreater0.05) in terms of E.coli O157:H7 or Salmonella occurrence. At present, this model has low chance of E.coli O157:H7 and Salmonella being present in the feed and fecal matter, but long term studies including evaluation of meat products and rotational crops might help us better understand the stability of this system.},

  abstract = {Associations between plants and microorganisms exist in nature, and they can either be beneficial or detrimental to host plants. Promoting beneficial plant-microbe interaction for increased crop yield and quality is one pathway to eco-friendly and sustainable crop production. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) are microorganisms that are beneficial to horticultural crops. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi establish symbioses with plant roots which help to improve nutrient uptake by the host plant and alter its physiology to withstand external abiotic factors and pathogens. Plant growth promoting bacteria promote plant growth either directly by aiding resource acquisition and controlling the levels of plant hormones or indirectly by reducing the inhibitory effects of phytopathogens. Co-inoculation of both organisms combines the benefits of each for increased crop productivity. Even though the co-inoculation of PGPB and AMF have been shown to enhance the yield and quality of crops, its benefits have fully not been exploited for horticultural crops. In this review, the response of horticultural crops to co-inoculation with PGPB and AMF with particular interest to the impact on the yield and crop quality was discussed. We explained some of the mechanisms responsible for the synergy between AMF and PGPB in plant growth promotion. Finally, suggestions on areas that need to be researched further to exploit and improve the effects of these organisms were highlighted.},

  abstract = {The question how to model the spread of epidemics has been approached countless times. The number of different methods used on this problem is not too small either. Ordinary differential equations (ODE) and Partial differential equations (PDE) have dominated this field for several decades, if not centuries. In the second half of the last century two alternative techniques appeared on the stage, namely cellular automata (CA) and agent based (AB) models, also called multi agent systems (MAS). The difference between the approach with differential equations and the latter two methods is big. CA and MAS are so called “bottomup” approaches, focusing on the smallest unit of the system – a cell or agent, whereas ODEs try to model the system via causal connections on the macroscopic level. Setting up a SIR-type model using the AB approach one can take advantage of state charts to control the behavior of agents. Using AnyLogic as implementation platform agents and especially state charts can be programmed very conveniently. Especially modifications and/or extensions of the final model can be handled in an elegant way. The right figure does show all necessary adjustments to expand the SIR- to a SIRS-type epidemic (additional state transition highlighted). The results obtained by simulation with such an MAS are comparable to those of the ODE- and CA-approach, although AB modeling offers a higher degree of freedom and thus more possibilities of adjustment.},

Aquaponics is a concept relatively new to modern food production methods and can contribute to food security. This study was conducted to establish sustainable aquaculture systems that maximize benefits and minimize the accumulation of detrimental compounds and other types of negative impacts on both natural and social environments. This study carried out at an average inflow rate of 1.28 m/day to evaluate the operation of the aquaponics recirculation system (ARS) on nutrients removal and growth and yield of African catfish as well as water spinach. A special design of ARS was used to provide nitrification of fishery wastewater, where the combination of sands and gravels in hydroponics trough, providing both surfaces for biofuel development and cultivation area for plants. Removal efficiencies of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), and orthophosphate (PO43-) were 82\%, 89\%, 93\%, 94\%, 81\%, and 80\%, respectively. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) and specific growth rate (SGR) of African catfish were 1.08 and 3.34\% day-1, respectively. The average water spinach production was 3.56 kg per m2. This study showed that ARS is a method of producing crop along with a healthy protein source and among the best alternatives for achieving economic and environmental sustainability.},

The type and quantity of waste excretions produced by the cultured organisms are also the important considerations, especially in designing the component system. Therefore, to be effective at nutrient removal, aquaponic systems should be sized correctly to balance fish output and nutrient uptake by plants. In this study, the plant component was isolated from the fish rearing operation so that nutrient removal could be evaluated independently. Two leafy green vegetables, i.e. water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) and mustard green (Brassica juncea) were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of plant nutrient uptake to balance nutrient production from fish culture. Results indicated that nitrogen utilization efficiencies of water spinach and mustard green were 66.5 and 59.9\%, respectively. In addition, water spinach-based aquaponics had better water quality than that of mustard green-based aquaponics, primarily due to its higher root surface area. The growth performance of African catfish showed the feed conversion ratio was in the range 1.18–1.33. The results obtained from this study indicated that both crops have considerable impacts on nutrient removal.},

  abstract = {The growths of the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) and water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) were evaluated in recirculation aquaponic system (RAS). Fish production performance, plant growth and nutrient removal were measured and their dependence on hydraulic loading rate (HLR) was assessed. Fish production did not differ significantly between hydraulic loading rates. In contrast to the fish production, the water spinach yield was significantly higher in the lower hydraulic loading rate. Fish production, plant growth and percentage nutrient removal were highest at hydraulic loading rate of 1.28 m/day. The ratio of fish to plant production has been calculated to balance nutrient generation from fish with nutrient removal by plants and the optimum ratio was 15–42 gram of fish feed/m2 of plant growing area. Each unit in RAS was evaluated in terms of oxygen demand. Using specified feeding regime, mass balance equations were applied to quantify the waste discharges from rearing tanks and treatment units. The waste discharged was found to be strongly dependent on hydraulic loading rate.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic research seemed to be characterized by experiments conducted in warm water systems while experiments in cold water systems were almost non-existent per August 2016. The main aim of this thesis was therefore to produce more data on the growth and development of plant species and cultivars in a cold water system. One preliminary study and one comparative study was conducted to examine the growth and development of the lettuce cultivars ‘Frillice’ and ‘Salanova Excite R2’, the coriander cultivar ‘Marino’ and the swiss chard cultivar ‘Bulls Blood’ when grown in an aquaponic system optimized for lettuce production. No significant difference between any of the growth parameters (yield, fresh weight of leaves and roots, fresh weight of leaves per rockwool cube, height and number of leaves, length of roots) and production system was found (p{$<$}0.05). The nutrient concentrations of plants, fish and water were analyzed. The largest ‘Frillice’ yield of 19540 g obtained in the preliminary monoculture study was higher than reported from other cold water experiments, but lower than reports from warm water experiments.  Results from the comparative study showed that the highest aquaponic yield was produced by ‘Salanova Excite R2’ and ‘Frillice’. The average fresh weights of ‘Salanova Excite R2’ and ‘Frillice’ leaves were significantly higher than ‘Bulls Blood’ and ‘Marino’ leaves (p{$<$}0.05). The average leaf weights per rockwool cube of ‘Salanova Excite R2’ and ‘Frillice’ were significantly higher than the leaf weights per cube of ‘Marino’ and ‘Bulls Blood’ (p{$<$}0.05). ‘Marino’ produced both significantly heavier and longer roots when compared to the three other cultivars (p{$<$}0.05). ‘Salanova Excite R2’ obtained the highest number of leaves (p{$<$}0.05) and ‘Marino’ produced the tallest leaf average of all cultivars (p{$<$}0.05).  The average fish weights and lengths were 122.37 g, 22.07 cm, and 177.67 g, 23.41 cm for bleke (Salmo salar L.) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), respectively. Brown trout was recommended for cold water aquaponic production because it achieved a higher harvest weight and grew faster than bleke. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) might also be good options for nutrient production in aquaponic systems. Nutrient concentrations were similar in the preliminary and comparative studies with the exception of higher sodium concentrations being found in both aquaponic plants and water in the comparative study.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), where plants and aquatic animals are grown using the same water. In these systems, plants act as part of biological filters. The cultivation of O. basilicum, Menta x piperita and M. spicata is commonly integrated to the production of O. niloticus in aquaponics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of these herbs as part of biological filters for tilapia intensive production in aquaponics. Various physicochemical parameters were evaluated as water quality indicators. N and P content in the different elements of the system were also measured. Results showed that for tilapia growing the three herbaceous evaluated could be used as part of the biological filters in aquaponics, because they remove significant concentration in nitrogen compounds and phosphates; however, there were no differences among species. There was a positive relationship between the time and the levels of NH4 and therefore NO3À in the water. The pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen were kept at appropriate ranges for tilapia. The electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids were in suitable levels for growing herbaceous, which adapted to flooded substrates, with water constantly moving and high concentration of dissolved oxygen. A key parameter to consider is the oxygen concentration in water when herbaceous is used in aquaponics, due to the high input of this element for these species need, especially basil. Tilapia largely incorporated N and P entering the system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an emerging area of ecological aquaculture comprising diverse technologies that converge on integrating recirculating aquaculture and hydroponics in one production unit. It has made possible to simultaneously produce fish and vegetables with nutrient cascading and water conservation as among its core concepts. While production of these food items is the material output of the system, there is a complexity of processes involved which opens a vast scope for innovations. Production of fish and plants integrated in the aquaponics fluctuates depending on the various biodynamic links that influence the nutrient turnover and water quality across the unit. A successful operation of aquaponics production unit, therefore, requires a thorough understanding of the whole system as a functioning ecosystem comprising fish, plant and the nitrifying bacteria. These biological components differ in their optimum requirements but the overall homoeostasis of the composite system can be maintained through regulating the water quality and nutrient profiles by way of adaptive interventions for acceptable tradeoffs. Balancing of nutrients by appropriate rates of stocking of fed and extractor species, feeding based on nutrient composition and anticipated excreted nutrients are essential for sustainability of aquaponics. It deserves emphasis that with so many variables in the system, there is obviously a vast scope for unlimited diversification and innovations to improve the production efficiency and sustainability. Regions facing water stress or where conservation of water is a priority will particularly benefit from aquaponics.},

  abstract = {A preliminary study on the effect of combination biofilters, including coral rubble, geotextile Aquamat TM (Meridian Aquatic Technology, Silver Spring, MD, USA), and algal aquaponics in a marine fish recirculating system was investigated. Aquamat TM is an innovative product fabricated from highly specialized synthetic polymer substrates. Aquamat TM forms a complex three-dimensional structure that resembles seagrass in appearance, and has been used to support high stocking densities in fish culture ponds and enhance biological processes. In addition, coral rubble was used, and two seaweed species, Eucheuma spinosum and E. cottonii, were evaluated for their usefulness as aquaponic biofilters in a recirculating system. Results showed that the four different biofilters operating within the recirculating system were significantly different (P\textbackslash textless0.05) in NH 3-N and NO 3-N concentrations. The lowest mean NH 3-N concentration was recorded in the recirculating tank using Aquamat TM + seaweed + coral rubble, while the highest mean NO 3-N concentration was recorded in the recirculating tank using Aquamat TM + coral rubble. Fish weight gain and survival rates were not significantly different (p\textbackslash textless0.05) in the four recirculating systems. In the second experiment, three varieties. Eucheuma cottonii decayed in the early days, while the two varieties of E. spinosum decayed after 35 days. Once decayed, water quality impairment followed. This study concluded that Eucheuma species were not suitable as a method of biofiltration in a recirculating culture system. While these seaweeds do remediate water quality, they themselves require a good environment to perform this role. When conditions are not optimal for the stocked organisms, the co-culture system can produce negative results. Follow-up investigation is needed to determine the suitability of such integrated aquatic systems for a large-scale fish production in recirculation systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents data obtained through trials on small-scale aquaponics sub-system which performs the roles of biological and mechanical filters for aquaculture water quality remediation. Aquaponics is a bio-integrated food production system, consisting of closed recirculating aquaculture combined with hydroponics. The trials were conducted on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa chinensis) over a period of 70 days. The results revealed that the system is more efficient in terms of plant growth and does not adversely affect the growth of captive stock of fish. Mean ( ± S.D.) values of water temperature, DO, pH, NH3-N, NO2-N, NO3-N and PO4-P during the trial were 25.2 ± 0.25 °C, 6.6 ± 0.13 mg/L, 7.14 ± 0.06, 0.23 ± 0.02 mg/L, 0.39 ± 0.22 mg/L, 0.89 ± 0.37 mg/L and 0.45 ± 0.04 mg/L, respectively. The average total weight gain by O. niloticus was 637.2 ± 8.49 g, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1.47 ± 0.01 which indicated the efficiency of Nile tilapia in converting feed mass –a universally standard measure of efficiency of feed assimilation into weight gain, especially when there is no additional source of nourishment. High survival rate (95 ± 2.8\%) was noticed during the trials. The average ( ± SD) values of biomass gain by P. vulgaris and B. rapa were 951.6 ± 1.6 g and 85.3 ± 13.4 g, respectively. The system was cost-effective and efficient in purging the toxic waste from water, resulting in remediation of water quality for the recirculating aquaculture system. This reflected the effectiveness of biofiltration which is currently assessed by its ability to completely remove the ammonia and minimize the generation of nitrite.},

  abstract = {We propose stochastic models for predicting and analysing the production of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) cultivated in an aquaponic system. Fish and plants were cultivated in a shade house using 30, 60, and 90 fish/m3 employing an NFT system. Results from Monte Carlo simulation showed that higher yields of tilapia and cucumber, as well as larger plant sizes, were obtained by stocking at the highest density (90 fish/m3). At this density, with 95\% confidence, yields of tilapia varied from 39.60 to 59.26 kg/m3, the final length of lettuce leaves varied from 13.53 to 28.5 cm, the final length of cucumber plant varied from 119 to 235.3 cm, and biomass of cucumber varied from 0.98 to 0.99 kg/m2. Regression and sensitivity analyses showed that dissolved oxygen, density, temperature, and electrical conductivity significantly affected the production of tilapia; density, nitrites, pH, and temperature influenced lettuce production; ammonium, pH, and density affected the production of cucumber plants; and ammonium and density influenced yields of cucumber. The greatest certainty to achieve higher yields of large tilapia was found at low densities. For plants, there was more certainty of harvesting larger products when cultivated with tilapia stocked at the highest density. A preliminary economic analysis of tilapia production showed that net revenues ranged from USD\$ 18.50 to 81.76 per system, and that the best results were obtained when using the highest stocking density. We conclude that the models are useful for predicting and analysing the production of an aquaponic system.},

As for the water outlet, the total mean concentration of nitrite at 3.6 L/min was lower than others. Besides, the growth performances of plant which was flower and fruit present were slightly different. The best growth performance in Phaseolus vulgaris was at flow rate 0.6 L/min. The result analyzed by One-way Anova showed that there were no significant differences between water quality and growth performance of shrimp and plants at different flow rates in aquaponics system. Due to that, the design of aquaponics system at different flow rate was able to treat the prawn waste water and the plant can grow well. The excess feed and waste from M. rosenbergii gave dissolved inorganic nutrients which will be absorbed by the plant for supporting the growth.},

Both the highest fish growth and algal biomass increase were observed in the AA system at 2-day HRT, resulting in the highest nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) (39.28\%) in this microcosm. On the contrary, ammonia oxidation bacteria (AOB) abundance at 4-day HRT was approximately ten times higher than that at 2-day HRT, since longer HRT would benefit bacterial growth. The 15N labeling study showed that microalgae assimilation was the main pathway of NH4+ removal in the AA system, and oxygen produced by microalgae could in situ support complete nitrification, thus leading to much lower NH4+ concentrations at 2-day HRT. Accordingly, better water quality was achieved at 2-day HRT. Considering all the factors, HRT of 2-day was considered to be optimal for the AA system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the cultivation form that integrates aquaculture with hydroponics to nurture plants and fish simultaneously. And aeration plays an important role in its sustainable operation, as well as economic and environmental feasibility. In this study, two patterns to reduce aeration intensity, i.e., semiaeration (SA) and intermittent aeration (IA) were used to improve the economic and environmental benefits of media-based aquaponics. Results showed that SA aquaponics, in which the energy efficiencies on culturing fish and crop were improved respectively by 78.20\% and 77.61\% compared with Control, had the potential to obtain higher economic benefits. Although both SA and IA could save half of the aeration cost by reducing aeration flux and time respectively, the product yields in SA weren’t impaired seriously while in IA aquaponics they were. And the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of SA aquaponics was 11.3\% higher than that of IA aquaponics, mainly attributed to the more stable dissolved oxygen concentration in SA. Better water quality was obtained in IA aquaponics, however, it was achieved at the cost of higher N loss (mainly in the form of N2), which subsequently reduced the potential for further improvement of NUE. Both SA and IA could considerably reduce GHG emissions from aquaponics, due to lower energy requirement. IA aquaponics showed the lowest N2O emission, but the primary source (over 97\%) of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from aquaponics was off-site indirect CO2 emission. Taking productivity and environmental impact into consideration, semi-aeration was believed to be a better choice when reducing aeration.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, automation has become an essential feature in various applications. Agriculture is a crucial sector in which human being heavily depends on. Aquaponics is one of the efficient approaches in agriculture. Human resource allocated for aquaponics maintenance is very inefficient in terms of workload as compared to the time spent especially with the advanced technology we have today. It is necessary to include automation in aquaponics to reduce manpower involvement. However, a lack of attention has been given by local farmers to automate their aquaponics using technology. In this study, an automated aquaponics maintenance system was developed as a prototype to reduce human involvement in the activity. The system covers water level and light-emitting diode (LED) power switch maintenance. Furthermore, the automation system can be controlled via Telegram for user convenient. Moreover, it also measures the pH level of the water as an additional feature. Numerous tests were conducted on aquaponics to observe the reliability of the system at the Malaysian Institute of Sustainable Agriculture (MISA), a non-profit organization focusing on urban farming. Positive results were obtained from the tests which suggested that the system is self-dependent. Therefore, the system is suitable to be used in aquaponics.},

  abstract = {Environment performance is critical in freshwater aquaculture subject to fish diet formulation due to its negative impacts such as waters eutrophication and water quality. Problem on the water quality is not only impact on the fish growth itself but also will impact on the aquaculture business sustainability. Sustainability of fresh water aquaculture mainly relates to its environment performance subject to various resource management. Freshwater aquaculturist face a challenge to manage such resources to achieve their competitive advantage. The Resource-Based View (RBV) theory highlight on the firm ability to achieve their competitive advantage which dynamic capability is one of the main concern. The intensive freshwater aquaculture relied on feed as the primary factor to increase fish growth and production mainly. The feed might contribute 20 -30\% waste in environment. The objective of this study is to identify in what extend green feed technology can support the environment sustainability. This study use combination of field data experimental result and semi structure interview to the fish farmers and fish agents. Developing green feed is one of the solution to gain environment sustainability. Various commercial diets have been fed on freshwater cultured fishes using both cages and ponds. As the results, low digestible diet and wasted diet has increased N and P in water, which will decline water quality at certain level. It is recommended to formulate green feed using low P and high digestible ingredients as well as any supplement material, which could increase diet digestibility. Minimize waste possible done through increasing feeding efficiency and use multiple cages, polyculture, aquaponics system in ponds, and alternative fish by-product in the diet. Technology to support the environment sustainability can be implemented by arranging the C-N ratio of the water, which will raise production of both bioflocs and biofilms. Stocking multi species different food web is recommended.},

Fish were cultivated considering three development stages (fingerling of 1.79 g, juvenile of 36.13 g, and adult of 72.96 g). Nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, and phosphorus concentration were determined in order to know the amount of nutrients excreted per productive stage of the fish at a high stocking density. Biometric data were recorded during the experiment with the purpose of determining the growth behavior of fish, as well as the measurement of the aerobic metabolism. Results showed that survival, growth, and health of fish are not affected by hyperdensity of culture; as well, combined catabolism of proteins and lipids was presented as substrates for energy with value for O:N ratio ranging between 20 and 60. In addition, higher concentration in excretion of nitrogen compounds and phosphorus per gram of fish was recorded in wastewater from a hyperintensive culture in fingerlings than in juveniles and adults. These results suggest the use of this wastewater in the early stages of fish growth, aiming to enhance sustainable systems with maximum use of the resources, such as aquaponics systems.},

The main objective of this work was to compare basil production between horizontal and vertical decoupled aquaponic systems and assess the utilization of supplemental lighting in a greenhouse environment. Six independent vertical racks were arranged with hydroponic trays at three heights. Three racks were affixed with LED lighting on the lowest levels and three with supplemental lighting on the intermediate level. Immediately adjacent to the vertical systems, two independent horizontal systems containing three trays were constructed to compare basil production. After 35 days of growth post transplanting, the total production per tray and weight, height, number of leaves, and nodes of 20 selected plants per tray were determined. Records of the intensity of illumination photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)) were recorded at dawn (8:00), noon (12:00), and dusk (18:00) at randomly predetermined positions associated with the 20 selected plants per tray. The total basil production in the experiment was 58.79 kg, with an average production per unit area of 2.43 and 0.94 kg m−2 for vertical and horizontal systems, respectively. Productivity per unit area in the vertical systems was 160\% greater than in horizontal systems. A significant effect of lighting, the height of the tray, and plant position inside the tray was found on plant growth parameters. Optimization of light source distribution and tray orientation can enhance the productive performance in vertical aquaponic systems. Electricity cost associated with supplemental lighting per kg of production increment was 21.84 and 12.25 \$ kg−1 for the bottom and intermediate levels of the vertical system, respectively, the latter being economically the most profitable.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is emerging as an interesting alternative for sustainable agriculture which meets the philosophy of circular economy, decreasing not only the need of external resources but also increasing their use efficiency. Several studies can be found dealing with the analysis of different fish species combined with a great variety of crops in systems with diverse sophistication levels. Strawberry crop may be interesting for aquaponics systems. However, early production and the quality of the fruit, which are crucial factors affecting crop profitability, have not been previously assessed in aquaponics systems. This work aimed at evaluating these factors together with the consumption of resources in strawberry production using commercial multi-layer NFT channels coupled with tench production in an aquaponic system. Production of tench with low density of fish (700–1300 g m− 3) was associated to 2 hydroponic lines where plants were transplanted in rockwool plugs or bare roots. Despite the fact that the transplanting of the strawberries was performed one month later than usual for this crop, the extra-early production was 31.9 and 33.6 g per plant for rockwool and bare root substrates, respectively. No significant differences were found neither in strawberry production nor in fruit quality for the two types of substrates studied. However, parameters related to earliness varied differently along time between bare root and rockwool. The cultivation of bare root plants is recommended, since it involves lower costs by saving in the acquisition of the substrate and less environmental and health problems for workers. Despite the fact that tench is a species very well adapted to the weather conditions in the production area, its low average daily gain ratios and its long growth cycle makes it unsuitable for combination with the cultivation of strawberry. However, the combination of a joint production of fish and plants in simple aquaponic systems would allow savings in fertilizer and water, within a production framework of circular economy.},

  abstract = {In the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia, food security will be a matter of concern for policy makers. In desert countries the food commodities are mostly imported from other countries as their local production is not enough to meet the domestic needs and Saudi Arabia has no exception. Most of the cereals and red meat are imported. Major limiting factors in agriculture production are land and water, such that by 2050, Saudi Arabia is expected to import all of its domestic needs. Meanwhile, there are many land and water saving technologies which have the potential to help produce enough to meet the domestic energy requirements. Promotion of traditional crops, hydroponics and greenhouse farming, seawater harvesting, investing in bio-salinity research and rainwater harvesting are among those technologies. Therefore, role of extension agent is critical to promote the innovative technologies as well as creating awareness among farming community to implement the guidelines to meet the country dietary needs. This paper suggests substitute expertise and methodologies that can be engaged by Saudi Arabia under prevalent situation, which can be helpful to expand national food fabrication to achieve food security in the Kingdom. Efficient role of agriculture extension is need of the hour that should be exploited and utilized in a precise and efficient manner. All the possible strategies related to agricultural extension for prevailing agricultural challenges in the Kingdom are discussed in detail.},

The ADM1 model has been calibrated with reference to the degradation of waste activated sludge, based on literature data, and assumed as reference model. Then, in order to compare the outputs of the two models, some variables of ADM1 have been lumped to match the relevant aggregated AMOCO variables. Since AMOCO failed in predicting the steady state values relevant to the inorganic carbon species and alkalinity, a new version of it has been developed, accounting for the dynamics of the inorganic nitrogen concentration. Steady-state and dynamic simulations based on this new version showed an improvement with reference to simulations obtained with ADM1.},

Fish and plants are dependent the equilibrium of dissolved nutrients and water quality. Only by striking a balance between dissolved nutrients and water quality we can achieve a large production of plants and healthy fish. Thus, control of water quality in an aquaponic system is essential in order to obtain performance in raising fish and plants. The experiment was conducted in the laboratory of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Faculty of Animal Science of the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest within a period of 30 days. The system used for the experiment was designed and developed in the laboratory mentioned above. The plant used for water treatment in the system was basil (Ocimum basilicum). Fish species grown in the system was culture carp (Cyprinus carpio). Indicators measured to assess water quality in the system were: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total ammonia, nitrites, nitrates and phosphates. The values determined pH 7.4-7.6, dissolved oxygen 8-10 mg / l, NH4 0.05-05 mg/ l, NO2 0.1-3.2 mg / l, NO3 0-80 mg / l, 0.02-0.3 mg, PO4 0.02-0.3 mg/l were not too high. In conclusion it was demonstrated that water quality in the aquaponic system studied is propitious to the growth and welfare of fish the registered values are not to be harmful.},

  abstract = {The aquaponic recirculating systems are integrated systems that combine fish and plant culture. These systems consist of two components: aquaculture and hydroponics components. In these systems the nutrients necessary for plant growth are resulted from the metabolism of food by the fish. This was obtained by recirculation of water, with a pump, from the fish tank to the hydroponic component and back to the fish tank. The experiment was conducted in the laboratory of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Faculty of Animal Husbandry of University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest for 6 months. The system developed here, is a 1 m2 area of plant growth and 0.45 m3 of water in aquaculture component. In the hydroponic component river gravel was selected to support the plants and offer support for the growth and developing of nitrifying bacteria. The species cultivated were cultured carp (Cyprinus carpio) and basil (Ocimum basilicum). On average, there was obtained a quantity of about 1kg basil leaves in a period of 60 days of growth. It has been found that the species of plants grown in this system, namely basil (Ocimum basilicum) grown with carp (Cyprinus carpio), has a faster and better development compared to conventional growth. Use of basil as a purifying plant, resulted in the removal of nitrates, being not necessary to add additional water, as in classical recirculating systems, where is necessary to replace daily approx. 10\% of the volume of the culture water being necessary to add into the system only water lost through evaporation. According to the results the basil is suitable for aquaponic system with carp culture. The basil was grown much better than the conventional cultivation.},

  abstract = {Building a small scale aquaponic system can be considered as a source of profit. On the same floor area two products could be yield: fish and plants (herbs, vegetables, salads, ornamentals). The small scale aquaponic system was built in the laboratory of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Faculty of Animal Science of the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine in Bucharest. It has two components, namely component of aquaculture and hydroponics component. The aquaculture component is represented by a tank with a volume of 450 l and the hydroponic component that is composed of a parallelepipedic box lined with PVC foil of 0.5 mm. PVC film’s purpose is to retain water in the hydroponic component. The parallelopipedic box was made of OSB with reinforcements made of pine timber. The substrate chosen for plant growth was river gravel with dimensions between 8 and 16 mm. The surface obtained for the plant growth was 1 m2. Water recirculation was done with a pump with adjustable flow of 300 to 1000 l / h. An aerator with two diffusers was used to assure the fish respiration and the nitrification processes. Construction costs, initialization and use of such a system are small and do not require special knowledge, tools or skills. This system can be built and used in spaces where there is no possibility of using soil for plant growth (balconies, terraces, etc.). This way one can have available herbs, vegetables and fresh fish, even in an apartments building.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the integration of farming fish with plants where the excreted nutrients from fish are taken up by plants. Thus, aquaponics may enhance aquaculture sustainability and productivity. In this study, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides juveniles were cultured in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) or aquaponic system for two months. Each system was identical, but within the aquaponic system, lemongrass and spring onion were cultured with or without gravel in a 2x2x2 factorial design. After 2 months, there was no difference in the survival, growth, feeding efficiencies or condition indicator of fish in either system, despite nitrate-N being consistently higher in RAS, particularly from day 48 onwards. Water iron and total phosphorus were similar among each system. Bacterial diversity was lower in RAS, but Streptomyces was only detected in RAS which contributes to off-flavors. Spring onion wet weight and leaf width values were significantly greater when cultured with media but had significantly shorter roots. Lemongrass leaf length and width values were also significantly greater when cultured with media, but had significantly shorter roots. There were various signifi­ cant main effects on the mineral composition, particularly for iron. Generally, both zinc and iron accumulated in the roots of both plant while potassium was higher in the leaves. Spring onions were a richer source of potassium and calcium than lemongrass. Magnesium and iron were generally higher in the leaves and roots when cultured without media and might be due to the roots having a greater surface area for nutrient uptake. Overall, M. salmoides is a suitable high value fish species to grow with aquaponics while using media enhanced the productivity of both plant species as well as their magnesium and iron contents. The absence of Steptomyces in the aquaponic system may have implications to post-harvest fish quality that should receive additional attention.},

To achieve environmental conditions favorable for plant growth, greenhouses are designed with various components, structural shapes, and numerous types of glazing materials. They are operated differently according to each condition. To improve the pedagogy and the understanding of the complexity and dynamic behavior of greenhouse environments with different configurations, an interactive, dynamic greenhouse environment simulator was developed. The greenhouse environment model, based on energy and mass balance principles, was implemented in a web-based interactive application that allowed for the selection of the greenhouse design, weather conditions, and operational strategies. The greenhouse environment simulator was designed to be used as an educational tool for demonstrating the physics of greenhouse systems and environmental control principles. Several scenarios were simulated to demonstrate how a specific greenhouse design would respond environmentally for several climate conditions (four seasons of four geographical locations), and to demonstrate what systems would be required to achieve the desired environmental conditions. The greenhouse environment simulator produced realistic approximations of the dynamic behavior of greenhouse environments with different design configurations for 28-h simulation periods.},

  abstract = {This article assesses strategies for managing the economic returns to an aquaponics production system with joint products of lettuce and tilapia. Experimental data from Brazil that varied fish stocking density and the fish feeding rate are analyzed using nonparametric efficiency testing methods to identify potentially profitable technologies and their sensitivities to prices of inputs and outputs. Plants and fish production are symbiotic in an aquaponics system, with fish waste providing nutrients for plant growth and plants helping maintain water quality for the fish via filtration. The optimal input/output mix among alternatives is identified, and sensitivity analysis is used to assess the price ranges around recent market conditions (0.18 R\$/tilapia fingerling, 2.8 R\$/kg for fish feed, 20 R\$/kg for juvenile fish, and 1.57 R\$/kg for lettuce) over which that technology choice remains optimal. The configuration of production controls is robust to price changes. Results show that at low fish stocking densities (100 fish/m3), the effluent in the water provides insufficient nutrients to plants. In addition, early lettuce harvests (before 26 days) are generally less efficient than treatments that allow more time for plant growth. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the optimality of the identified configuration of production controls is robust with respect to input and output prices.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is generally regarded as a sustainable practice, but its environmental burdens were not yet deeply investigated. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to assess the environmental impacts of two hypothetical coupled aquaponics systems (CAPS): Raft System (RAFT) and Media-Filled Beds System (MFBS). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were considered as cultivated species in both systems. The Simapro©software V.8.0 was used for calculation. The comparison between the two virtual systems indicated the floating technique as the less impacting one. Even though energy consumption appears to be higher in the floating system, LCA results were markedly influenced by the extensive use of inert materials in MFSB. In both systems, contribution analyses underlined that the main environmental impacts are related to infrastructures, electricity and fish feed. The LCA analyses carried out in this study highlights that the choice of less impacting materials, and the optimization of management practices, should be taken as priorities in order to reduce environmental impacts of this activity.},

  abstract = {Global nitrogen fixation contributes 413 Tg of reactive nitrogen (N               r               ) to terrestrial and marine ecosystems annually of which anthropogenic activities are responsible for half, 210 Tg N. The majority of the transformations of anthropogenic N               r               are on land (240 Tg N yr               −1               ) within soils and vegetation where reduced N               r               contributes most of the input through the use of fertilizer nitrogen in agriculture. Leakages from the use of fertilizer N               r               contribute to nitrate (NO               3               −               ) in drainage waters from agricultural land and emissions of trace N               r               compounds to the atmosphere. Emissions, mainly of ammonia (NH               3               ) from land together with combustion related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO                                x                              ), contribute 100 Tg N yr               −1               to the atmosphere, which are transported between countries and processed within the atmosphere, generating secondary pollutants, including ozone and other photochemical oxidants and aerosols, especially ammonium nitrate (NH               4               NO               3               ) and ammonium sulfate (NH               4               )               2               SO               4               . Leaching and riverine transport of NO               3               contribute 40–70 Tg N yr               −1               to coastal waters and the open ocean, which together with the 30 Tg input to oceans from atmospheric deposition combine with marine biological nitrogen fixation (140 Tg N yr               −1               ) to double the ocean processing of N               r               . Some of the marine N               r               is buried in sediments, the remainder being denitrified back to the atmosphere as N               2               or N               2               O. The marine processing is of a similar magnitude to that in terrestrial soils and vegetation, but has a larger fraction of natural origin. The lifetime of N               r               in the atmosphere, with the exception of N               2               O, is only a few weeks, while in terrestrial ecosystems, with the exception of peatlands (where it can be 10               2               –10               3               years), the lifetime is a few decades. In the ocean, the lifetime of N               r               is less well known but seems to be longer than in terrestrial ecosystems and may represent an important long-term source of N               2               O that will respond very slowly to control measures on the sources of N               r               from which it is produced.},

A total of 64 marron were randomly distributed into 16 different tanks with a density of four marron per tank. After acclimation, a 60-days feeding trial was conducted on marron fed isonitrogenouts and isocalorific diets containing protein source from FM, PBM, and a combination of FM + BSF and PBM + BSF. At the end of the trial, weight gain and growth of marron were found independent of any dietary treatment, however, the two diets supplemented with BSF significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) enhanced haemolymph osmolality, lysozyme activity, total haemocyte counts, and protein and energy contents in the tail muscle. In addition, the analysis of microbiota and its predicted metabolic pathways via 16s rRNA revealed a significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) higher bacterial activity and gene function correlated to biosynthesis of protein, energy and secondary metabolites in PBM + BSF than other dietary groups. Diets FM + BSF and PBM + BSF were seen to be associated with an up-regulation of cytokine genes in the intestinal tissue of marron. Overall, PBM + BSF diet proved to be a superior diet in terms of improved health status, gut microbiota and up-regulated expression of cytokine genes for marron culture.},

  abstract = {Computer vision (CV) has been applied for years to automate many human activities. It is one of the key technologies for the modernization of the agri-food industry towards the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). In the agricultural sector, CV systems are applied to automate or obtain information from many agricultural tasks such as planting, cultivation, farm management, disease control, weed control or robotic harvesting. It is also widely used in postharvest to automate and obtain objective information in processes such as quality control and evaluation, damage detection, classification of fruits or vegetables in commercial categories or composition analysis. One of the main advantages is the ability of this technology to obtain information in regions of the spectrum that are invisible to the human eye. An example is the case of hyperspectral imaging systems. These systems generate a large amount of data that needs to be processed efficiently, creating robust and repeatable statistical models that allow the technology to be implemented at an industrial level. To achieve this, it is necessary to couple CV systems with advanced artificial intelligence tools such as machine learning or deep learning. The objective of this work is to review the latest advances in CV systems applied to food and agricultural products and processes.},

  abstract = {Greenhouses are used in many climates for season extension or yearround production and can be expensive to heat. Greenhouse users and growers are often faced with management decisions that rely on an understanding of how temperature settings, heating systems, fuel types, and construction decisions influence overall heating costs. There are no easy-to-use programs to calculate heating costs associated with these factors over full cropping seasons. A computer program called Virtual Grower was created that helps calculate heating costs at many U.S. sites. The program uses a weather database of typical hourly temperature, light, and wind information of 230 sites from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the calculations. A user can define unique design characteristics such as building material and construction style. The user also defines the type of heating system and heating schedule, and then the program will predict heating costs based on typical weather at the selected location. Shorter-term predictions with weather forecasts of 2 days or less can be made with the software if there is an internet connection through integration with local weather forecasts. Virtual Grower can serve as a platform from which many other features can be added, such as plant growth and scheduling. Continued development will improve the software and allow users to perform baseline analysis of their heating costs, identify areas in their production to improve efficiency, and take some of the guesswork out of energy analysis in unique greenhouses.},

  abstract = {As circular economy systems gain popularity with the environmental movement, the combination of raising fish (aquaculture) and growing crops outside of soil (hydroponics) appeals to many, especially in low-resource areas. But how environmentally friendly is it really, especially when compared to other farming technologies? This study aims to measure the energy, water, and nutrient inputs of a tilapia and tomato aquaponics system over a six-month growing season and compare those numbers to plant and fish biomass outputs. Then, the data is compared to traditional tomato farming, aquaculture, and hydroponics technologies to determine which has the best input to output ratios in each category. The system output 45.1 kg of plant biomass, 91.9 kg of tomatoes, and 21.6 kg of tilapia. Aquaponics is found to consume more water and energy than traditional and hydroponic tomato growth methods. Traditional farming was found to use 31.9 L water/kg tomato and produce 19.2 gCO2e/kg tomato. Hydroponics was found to consume 17 L water/kg tomato and produce 209 gCO2e/kg tomato. Aquaponics was found to utilize 186 L water/kg tomato and produce 28,300 gCO2e/kg tomato. However, aquaponics consumes less water and energy than traditional aquaculture. Aquaculture uses 1200 L water/kg tilapia and produces 62,100 gCO2e/kg tilapia while aquaponics uses 43.5 L water/kg tilapia and produces 28,200 gCO2e/kg tilapia.},

  abstract = {Under the new Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/848 which will enter into law in January 2022, aquaponic produce cannot be certified as organic in the European Union. Given the multiple components of an aquaponic system, which involve growing plants in hydroponic conditions, recycling of fish waste and raising fish in artificial conditions, the achievement of organic certification for aquaponic produce is a complex matter dictated by many parameters. Although in theory and in practice aquaponics fulfils nearly all organic farming principles, rules such as the need for crops to be cultivated in soil and the ban on using recirculating aquaculture systems currently prevent aquaponic produce from achieving organic certification. This review examines these rules in the new regulation on horticulture and aquaculture. The rules are evaluated, their foundations discussed, and suggestions are made on the type of system modifications that could potentially make it possible for aquaponic produce to be certified as organic. Suggested modifications include the use of soil in the hydroponic section and the implementation of environmental enrichment for improving the fish welfare in the aquaculture section. Several EU policies and strategies that support the development of aquaponics are also discussed, and potential policies for the development of organic aquaponics are formulated.},

  abstract = {Half of the seafood consumed globally now comes from aquaculture, or farmed seafood. Aquaculture therefore plays an increasingly important role in the global food system, the environment, and human health. Traditionally, aquaculture feed has contained high levels of wild fish, which is unsustainable for ocean ecosystems as demand grows. The aquaculture industry is shifting to crop-based feed ingredients, such as soy, to replace wild fish as a feed source and allow for continued industry growth. This shift fundamentally links seafood production to terrestrial agriculture, and multidisciplinary research is needed to understand the ecological and environmental health implications. We provide basic estimates of the agricultural resource use associated with producing the top five crops used in commercial aquaculture feed. Aquaculture's environmental footprint may now include nutrient and pesticide runoff from industrial crop production, and depending on where and how feed crops are produced, could be indirectly linked to associated negative health outcomes. We summarize key environmental health research on health effects associated with exposure to air, water, and soil contaminated by industrial crop production. Our review also finds that changes in the nutritional content of farmed seafood products due to altered feed composition could impact human nutrition. Based on our literature reviews and estimates of resource use, we present a conceptual framework describing the potential links between increasing use of crop-based ingredients in aquaculture and human health. Additional data and geographic sourcing information for crop-based ingredients are needed to fully assess the environmental health implications of this trend. This is especially critical in the context of a food system that is using both aquatic and terrestrial resources at unsustainable rates.},

This study focused on revealing the biological nature of the suppression against Fusarium wilt disease, which is caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, and describing the factors that may influence the fungal pathogen in the MPM system. We demonstrated that the rhizosphere microbiota that developed in the MPM system could suppress Fusarium wilt disease under in vitro and green-house conditions. The microbiological characteristics of the MPM system were able to control the population dynamics of F. oxysporum, but did not eradicate the fungal pathogen. The roles of the microbiological agents underlying the disease suppression and the magnitude of the disease suppression in the MPM system appear to depend on the microbial density. F. oxysporum that survived in the MPM system formed chlamydospores when exposed to the rhizosphere microbiota. These results suggest that the microbiota suppresses proliferation of F. oxysporum by controlling the pathogen's morphogenesis and by developing an ecosystem that permits coexistence with F. oxysporum.},

  abstract = {Resources such as fertile soil and clean water are already limited in many parts of the world. Additionally, the conventional use of arable land is becoming increasingly difficult, which is further exacerbated by climate change. Soilless cultivation systems do not only offer the opportunity to save water and cultivate without soil but also the chance to open up urban areas such as residential rooftops for food production in close proximity to consumers. In this review, applications of soilless farming systems are identified and compared to conventional agriculture. Furthermore, aspects of economic viability, sustainability and current developments are investigated. An insight into the most important soilless farming systems—hydroponics, aquaponics and vertical farming—is provided. The systems are then differentiated from each other and, as far as possible, evaluated in terms of their environmental impact and compared with conventional cultivation methods. Comparing published data analyzing the yield of hydroponic cultivation systems in comparison to soil-based cultivation methods enables a basic overview of the profitability of both methods and, thus, lays the foundation for future research and practical applications. The most important inert substrates for hydroponic applications are presented, and their degree of sustainability is compared in order to emphasize environmental impacts and affect substrate selections of future projects. Based on an assessment of the most important soilless cultivation systems, the challenges and developments of current techniques are highlighted and discussed.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a horticulture technique that has been increasing in popularity for industry and household use. It converts the ammonia fish waste to nitrites and nitrates through nitrifying bacteria, Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter. The treated water is used to fertilize plants on a hydroponic bed. Recirculation and treatment conserves water but can lead to an accumulation of various toxins. This project focuses on the effects and accumulation of dosing systems with selenium and neem oil. Selenium is an essential nutrient for humans with a narrow daily intake range of 40-400μg. Selenoproteins mediate oxidative stress through use of the encoded amino acid selenocysteine (SeCys), while selenium-containing proteins accumulate selenomethionine SeMet. Neem oil is an effective organic pesticide that is used widely throughout the agriculture industry. It is effective against insects, but the effects on nitrifying bacteria in aquaponics are not known. Selenium was dossed to the water and later quantified in various foodstuffs and water collected from the systems. Samples were analyzed with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The accumulation of Se in water was more pronounced from inorganic species; compared with organics that showed more accumulation in foodstuff. The active molecule of neem oil, azadirachtin, and its degraded form were detected via Reverse-Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) in foodstuff. Chlorophyll content in leaves was determined with UV spectroscopy and used to determine the health of the systems metabolism.},

Its impact has been assessed as a main driver for soil degradation, deforestation, water bed contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions. Germany is one of the largest consumers and producers of livestock products in the world. This high volume demand for livestock forces farmers and consumers to import from overseas and increase national yields. Technologies worldwide are being developed with a focus on sustainability and cleaner production; however, this may not necessarily be easily adapted and implemented by German farmers. This paper uses the technology roadmap approach to propose a plan for implementing these technologies by identifying the barriers and actions to remove them. Aquaponics, grazing management, and capturing methane are current global trends used in the effort to reduce the impact of livestock. While aquaponics are at an early stage of development and implementation in Germany, grazing management techniques and methane processing on free range cattle are mostly still unknown and not implemented by farmers producing in the country.},

The industrial production of collagen mostly relies on its extraction from mammals, but several issues limited its use. In the last two decades, marine organisms attracted interest as safe, abundant, and alternative source for collagen extraction. In particular, the possibility to valorize the huge quantity of fish industry waste and byproducts as collagen source reinforced perception of fish collagen as eco-friendlier and particularly attractive in terms of profitability and cost-effectiveness. Especially fish byproducts from eco-sustainable aquaponics production allow for fish biomass with additional added value and controlled properties over time. Among fish species, Oreochromis niloticus is one of the most widely bred fish in large-scale aquaculture and aquaponics systems. In this work, type I collagen was extracted from aquaponics-raised Tilapia skin and characterized from a chemical, physical, mechanical, and biological point of view in comparison with a commercially available analog. Performed analysis confirmed that the proprietary process optimized for type I collagen extraction allowed to isolate pure native collagen and to preserve its native conformational structure. Preliminary cellular studies performed with mouse fibroblasts indicated its optimal biocompatibility. All data confirmed the eligibility of the extracted Tilapia-derived native type I collagen as a biomaterial for healthcare applications.},

Results showed that weight gain rate and specific growth rate did not significantly differ among the eight groups. However, most blood parameters significantly differed among the eight groups. The glucose level and activities of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were generally larger in Cd, Lm, Vn, and CK groups, and smaller in Ia, Ls, or At groups. Additionally, the triglyceride, cholesterol, albumin, and albumin/globulin were mostly elevated in Ia and At groups. Moreover, the creatinine, total proteins, and globulin levels peaked in Vn group. These findings showed that the blood biochemical profile was more sensitive than the growth performances and that hydroponic plants can induce a higher production and more healthy status of Qihe crucian carp C. auratus when compared with aquatic plants or no plants.},

  abstract = {The application of conservation methods plays a very important role in reducing the rate of food losses and waste. In Mexico, for the year 2017, 10.4 million tons were reported as food waste, and of this total, 5.4\% corresponded to mango waste (Mangifera indica.L). Dehydration is one of the most common food preservation methods; To carry out this process, conventional methods are usually used that can generate the loss of the main sensory and organoleptic characteristics due to the heat sensitivity of the nutrients and the physicochemical changes that occur in the product during the process. The Refractive Window method represents an emerging technology in the field of food conservation based on the transfer of energy, mainly by thermal radiation; therefore, the purpose of this research was to analyze the dehydrated mango pulp using the VR method by applying sensory evaluation procedures, applying water temperatures of 80 °C, 85 °C and 90 °C for 20, 15 and 10 minutes respectively, considering 2 mm and 3 mm thickness for each test; additionally, the product obtained by this method was compared with a control obtained from the dehydration of mango pulp by tray. The results indicated greater acceptance towards the product obtained by the use of V.R. due to the greater intensity of mango aroma and flavor, as well as a better texture and aesthetics of the product.},

  abstract = {Population growth implies the need to produce more food. This increases pressure on the planet’s resources, which drives climate change and challenges environmental sustainability. Hence, it is important to promote sustainable agriculture strategies that contribute to global food and nutrition security while protecting natural resources. These strategies should be guided from an educational perspective that motivates people to develop positive bonds with nature. In this regard, augmented reality has emerged as a technology with the potential to improve environmental education programs. This paper presents the development and evaluation of an augmented reality-based educational application, whose purpose is to foster sustainable agriculture in the context of aquaponics. The application was developed using Unity and Vuforia following the principles of instructional design. To evaluate the effectiveness of the application, we designed a pilot study with 10 volunteers. The results indicate that the application has the potential to motivate users to learn, which suggests that it is appropriate to foster sustainable agriculture strategies in the context of aquaponics.},

  abstract = {Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is an important member of the Solanaceae family. It is mainly used as food and cash crop globally. Tomato also serves as an ornamental plant in some parts of the world. In urban areas, this crop is included in the foodscaping systems where it is grown in hanging baskets, growing pots and aquaponics for aesthetic and food purposes. Tomato production is mainly done for fresh and processing market niches. Most developed countries process a larger portion of tomato than is offered in fresh form. Cultivation of tomato is practiced on the open field and inside greenhouses. Greenhouse production has gained popularity recently. Determinate varieties are produced outdoor while indeterminate ones are produced in greenhouses and tunnels. Due to good adaptability, heirloom tomato varieties are becoming popular especially where farmers practice tomato grafting using the indigenous varieties as rootstocks. High cost of inputs, pest and diseases, postharvest losses and marketing are the major challenges facing tomato production globally. Organic tomato production is an emerging market niche. This is due to the increased consumer awareness, environmental conservation requirements and globalization. Thus, farmers have been making strides towards compliance to organic and other sustainable standards. These standards require adoption of the requisite practices, documentation, verification and certification by a third party. Value addition in tomato is an important aspect in addressing the postharvest challenges, product diversification and ultimately profitability. This review paper is expected to provide the requisite information in tomato value chain to ensure sustainable production of tomato globally.},

In addition to this, the United Nations sustainable development goals recommended implementing sustainable practices to meet food demand to achieve sustainability. Currently, aquaponics is one of the sustainable practices that require less land and water and has a low environmental impact. Aquaponics is a closed-loop and soil-less method of farming, where it requires intensive monitoring, control, and management. The advancement of wireless sensors and communication protocols empowered to implementation of an Internet of Things- (IoT-) based system for real-time monitoring, control, and management in aquaponics. This study presents a review of the wireless technology implementation and progress in aquaponics. Based on the review, the study discusses the significant water and environmental parameters of aquaponics. Followed by this, the study presents the implementation of remote, IoT, and ML-based monitoring of aquaponics. Finally, the review presents the recommendations such as edge and fog-based vision nodes, machine learning models for prediction, LoRa-based sensor nodes, and gateway-based architecture that are beneficial for the enhancement of wireless aquaponics and also for real-time prediction in the future.},

In Brazil, this integration has attracted the attention of researchers and producers. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two substrates (crushed stone number 3, CS III and flexible polyurethane foam, FPF) on the production of aquaponic lettuce, moreover, to show that the residual water from intensive tilapia production provides sufficient qualitative characteristics for competitive production of lettuce without adding commercial fertilizers. The treatment in which FPF was used provided higher concentrations of macro and micronutrients in the shoots, higher production of fresh matter of shoots (95.48 g plant-1) and a larger number of leaves (14.90) relative to CS III. These results were attributed to the lower post-transplanting stress and the higher water retention time provided by the FPF. The residual water from tilapia intensive farming can provide sufficient nutrients for the production of lettuce, making the supplementary fertilization with commercial products unnecessary. Thus, the FPF presents the most suitable conditions to be used as substrate in aquaponics system with recirculation of the residual water from the intensive tilapia farming.},

  abstract = {A new physico-chemical process for ammonia removal from fresh-water recirculated aquaculture systems (RASs) is introduced. The method is based on separating NH4+ from RAS water through an ion-exchange resin, which is subsequently regenerated by simultaneous chemical desorption and indirect electrochemical ammonia oxidation. Approach advantages include (1) only slight temperature dependence and no dependence on bacterial predators and chemical toxins; (2) no startup period is required and the system can be switched on and off at will; and (3) the fish are grown in much lower bacterial concentration, making the potential for both disease and off-flavor, lower. A small pilot scale RAS was operated for 51 d for proving the concept. The system was stocked by 105 tilapia fish (initial weight 35.8 g). The fish, which were maintained at high TAN (total ammonia nitrogen) concentrations (10–23 mgN L−1) and fish density of up to 20 kg m−3, grew at a rate identical to their established growth potential. NH3(aq) concentrations in the fish tank were maintained lower than the assumed toxicity threshold (0.1 mgN L−1) by operating the pond water at low pH (6.5–6.7). The low pH resulted in efficient CO2 air stripping, and low resultant CO2(aq) concentrations ({$<$}7 mg L−1). Due to efficient solids removal, no nitrification was observed in the fish tank and measured nitrite and nitrate concentrations were very low. The system was operated successfully, first at 10\% and then at 5\% daily makeup water exchange rate. The normalized operational costs, calculated based on data derived from the pilot operation, amounted to 28.7 \$ cent per kg fish feed. The volume of the proposed process was calculated to be ∼13 times smaller than that of a typical RAS biofilter. The results show the process to be highly feasible from both the operational and economical standpoints.},

Respondents reported the subjects taught, target audiences, number of participating students or visitors, and the resources and funding used by their organizations. Respondents used aquaponics to engage students in a variety of STEM subjects. In total, respondents and their institutions engaged an estimated range of 12,320 to 50,250 participants per year in aquaponics education. The typical school invested \$1,000 to \$4,999 US dollars (USD) in their aquaponics facility during the previous year, with a combined total of \$1.4 to \$6.6 million USD invested by all academic institutions. Aquaponics is an emerging educational tool, and there is a need for continued collaboration, technical support, and training for educators from universities and aquaculture education and research centers in the US and other countries.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is emerging as a novel technology with particular potential for urban agriculture (UA). The social acceptance of aquaponics and its place in urban food planning has not previously been studied. This study used focus groups, key informant interviews, and scenario analyses to investigate the reactions of Adelaide’s urban food opinion leaders and local government area (LGA) officials to aquaponics. Most of the focus group participants were unfamiliar with aquaponics. The perceived negatives of the technology received greater attention than the perceived benefits. Aquaponics was thought to be most competitive in either niche or wholesale markets, with a need for scaled guidelines from backyard to large-scale commercial production. For aquaponics in urban settings the influence of urban planning and policy is an important, but to date unstudied, consideration. The urban growers’ opinions of the overcomplicated nature of urban food planning corresponded with the mixed policy responses of the LGAs towards UA. This further supports the participants’ desire for a supportive State Government stance on UA to encourage consistency in LGAs.},

  abstract = {Five plants were examined for their ability to remove nutrients from aquaculture wastewater and suitability as fish feed: alfalfa, white clover, oat, fall rye, barley. The seeds were first germinated in water in a hydroponic system, and the plants were fed wastewater from Tilapia production facility. Clover and alfalfa seeds were infected with fungus shortly after germination, and their roots were completely destroyed by day 14. Oat, rye and barley had the fastest growth and showed greater tolerance to fungal disease compared with alfalfa and clover. Although substantial amounts of soluble and insoluble substances were released by the seeds during the germination period, the plants were able to remove all the pollutants in wastewater and significant portions of those released substances. The total reductions in total solids, COD, NO3 –N, NO2 – N, phosphate and potassium ranged from 54.7\% to 91.0\%, 56.0\% to 91.5\%, 82.9\% to 98.1\%, 95.9\% to 99.5\%, 54.5\% to 93.6\% and 99.6\% to 99.8\%, respectively. Oat, barley and rye grow well in this type of hydroponic system and can be used as a fish feed after being supplemented with fat, Ca, Na, Mn and Fe. Oil seeds and the chlorides of these elements could be added to these plants when formulating the fish feed. For a continuous operation, a two-unit system could be configured to allow for one week germination and one week cleaning and startup in one unit while the other unit is in operation.},

  abstract = {There are many pressures on the global food system such as urbanization, climate change, and environmental degradation. Urban agriculture is an approach to producing food inside cities where, globally, more than half the worlds population live. It has been shown to have a range of potential benefits, for instance in reducing waste and logistics costs. Increased uptake of urban farming can even relieve pressure on the natural environment by reducing the burden of production required from farmland by creating space for it to recover from accumulated damage as a result of the use of unsustainable farming practices historically. This article describes an approach for a new type of decision support system suitable for urban farming production. We discuss differences between the requirements and the users of decision support in urban agriculture, and those of ordinary agribusiness enterprises. A case study is performed using a novel technology for urban farming: a cyber-physical implementation of aquaponics is enhanced with adaptive capabilities using a digital twin system and machine learning. Aquaponics is a farming technique that utilizes a harmonious nutrient exchange cycle for growing plants and fish together, while conserving water, and possibly without the need for soil or even sunlight. Empirical results are provided that evaluate the use of data driven decision analytics and a digital twin model to plan production from the aquaponic system during a three month trial. Another set of results evaluate a proposed modelling framework for large scale urban agriculture ecosystems. This concept forms the basis of the suggested approach for an urban farming decision support system that coordinates the activities of many independent producers to target collective goals.},

It shows that the commonly used dummy variable or moving average deviation methods to estimate the seasonal gap can yield substantial upward bias. This can be partially circumvented using trigonometric and sawtooth models, which are more parsimonious. Among staple crops, seasonality is highest for maize (33 percent on average) and lowest for rice (16½ percent). This is two and a half to three times larger than in the international reference markets. Seasonality varies substantially across market places but maize is the only crop in which there are important systematic country effects. Malawi, where maize is the main staple, emerges as exhibiting the most acute seasonal differences. Reaching the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger requires renewed policy attention to seasonality in food prices and consumption.},

The nutraceutical value of tomatoes can be affected by the cultivation conditions, e.g. the phytochemical content of the fruits may increase with the establishment of beneficial mycorrhizal symbioses in the plants. A multidisciplinary study was carried out to gain knowledge on the antioxidant, oestrogenic/anti-oestrogenic and genotoxic activity of tomato fruits produced by mycorrhizal plants. The present results showed that the symbiosis positively affected the growth and mineral nutrient content of tomato plants and enhanced the nutritional and nutraceutical value of tomato fruits through modifications of plant secondary metabolism, which led to increased levels of lycopene in fruits obtained from mycorrhizal plants, compared with controls. Moreover, such changes did not result in the production of mutagenic compounds, since tomato extracts induced no in vitro genotoxic effects. Fruit extracts, both hydrophilic and the lipophilic fractions, originating from mycorrhizal plants strongly inhibited 17-b-oestradiol – human oestrogen receptor binding, showing significantly higher anti-oestrogenic power compared with controls. The present study shows that beneficial plant symbionts, such as mycorrhizal fungi, can lead to the production of safe and high-quality food, which is an important societal issue strongly demanded by both consumers and producers.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics, as a vertical farming technique, has undergone various developments to make it an efficient replacement for conventional farming methods. Hydroponics, a soil-less farming method has been combined with Aquaculture (fish-farming) to obtain a system with its own ecological balance. The disadvantages of these systems are overcome by the symbiotic relationship between them. As a result, Aquaponics has a better production and growth rate than other farming methods and economically this method is a viable solution. Green revolution led to various chemical fertilizers and pesticides being used to produce more crops. However, this affected the health of the public in the long run and agriculture once again became stagnant. With a growth in general awareness, people began turning back to Organic farming methods. Various individuals adopted methods like terrace farming, bonsai farming, and hybrid plants in an effort towards healthier farming. However, these methods could only be applied on a small scale and could never meet the demands. The various parameters that are to be considered during the design and implementation of an Aquaponics system have been discussed in this paper.},

The tanks were supplied with brackish groundwater at 3 and 6 ppt, and stocked with red hybrid tilapia (initial stocking density 100 kg/m3). When tilapia were cultured intensively in tank systems, with low daily water exchange, some dissolved nutrients including magnesium, calcium, sulphur and boron accumulated to approach or exceed levels suitable for fertilising vegetable crops. Some key nutrients, including nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus were deficient.

Most fish are grown in constructed ponds or floating cages in natural or man-made water bodies. Freshwater fish farming is often integrated with the farming of crops, where wastes and by-products from one component are used as inputs for another. Developing technologies offer new opportunities to conserve water and increase the productivity of freshwater aquaculture. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have been developed with the potential to greatly reduce the water requirements and environmental impacts of fish farms. Biofloc technologies (BT) utilize in situ bacterial processes to maintain water quality and provide food for filter-feeding species of fish and crustaceans. Full integration of fish and vegetable production can be achieved through aquaponics, which combines aquaculture and hydroponic plant production within a recycled water system. This chapter reviews current developments in water recirculation techniques, biofloc technology and aquaponics against the background of increasing food security needs and water resource issues.},

  abstract = {Around one third of the globe is classified as desert or arid ({$<$}200 mm rain annually) and most such regions lack food security. Traditional freshwater aquaculture is often a marginal activity and competes with agriculture for limited water resources. Developing technologies offer new opportunities to increase farm productivity through integration with vegetable production in aquaponic systems and to reduce water requirements through the application of biofloc technology. Aquaponic systems combine aquaculture and hydroponic plant production and are integrated within a re-cycled water system. Fish waste metabolites provide the nutrients for plants grown in soil-less, hydroponic systems. Biofloc fish production systems operate with minimum or zero water exchange. Suspended biofloc particles develop in fish tanks under conditions of full aeration and controlled carbon to nitrogen ratios. They comprise algae, bacteria, protozoa and particulate organic matter held in a loose matrix. They provide in-situ treatment of harmful fish metabolites, are protein rich, contain essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals and supplement the diets of filter-feeding farmed species. The integration of fish culture with vegetable production provides new opportunities for small and medium enterprises. Integrated farms occupy a small footprint, optimise the use of resources and can be built close to population centres. This paper reviews current developments in aquaponics, including recent research into the incorporation of biofloc technology in aquaponics, against the background of food security needs in arid regions.},

The current strategies for supplying more produce are neither ecologically sound nor address the issues of the circular economy of reducing waste whilst meeting the WHO’s Millennium Development Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty by 2015. Aquaponics, a technology that integrates aquaculture and hydroponics, provides part of the solution. Although aquaponics has developed considerably over recent decades, there are a number of key issues that still need to be fully addressed, including the development of energy-efficient systems with optimized nutrient recycling and suitable pathogen controls. There is also a key issue of achieving profitability, which includes effective value chains and efficient supply chain management. Legislation, licensing and policy are also keys to the success of future aquaponics, as are the issues of education and research, which are discussed across this book.},

However, there is a lack of quantitative research to support the development of economically feasible aquaponics systems. Although many studies have addressed some scientific aspects, there has been limited focus on commercial implementation. In this review paper, opportunities that have the potential to fill the gap between research and implementation of commercial aquaponic systems have been identified. The analysis shows that aquaponics is capable of being an important driver for the development of integrated food production systems.

While several studies have documented the aerobic and anaerobic digestion performance of aquaculture sludge, the impact of the digestate on plant growth has yet to be understood. The present study examines the impact of either an aerobic or an anaerobic digestion effluent on lettuce plant growth, by enriching a mixture of aquaculture and tap water with supernatants from both aerobic and anaerobic batch reactors. The lettuce plants grown in the hydroponic system supplied with supernatant from an anaerobic reactor had significantly better performance with respect to weight gain than both, those in the system where supernatant from the aerobic reactor was added, as well as the control system. It can be hypothesized that this effect was caused by the presence of NH4+ as well as dissolved organic matter, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and fungi, and humic acid, which are predominantly present in anaerobic effluents. This study should therefore be of value to researchers and practitioners wishing to further develop sludge remineralization in aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {Decoupled multi-loop aquaponics systems separate the recirculated aquaculture system (RAS) and hydroponic (HP) units from each another, creating detached ecosystems with inherent advantages for both plants and fish. This gives the advantage of improved crop and fish cultivation in combination, using the minimum resource input. Up to today, the focus of aquaponics systems is mainly on fish culture and treatment of RAS effluent for optimal use in HP, and systems are designed and sized with rule of thumbs of plant growth, evapotranspiration and nutrient needs, while taking the slow responses of RAS dynamics as basis. However, in order to create the optimal fit between RAS and HP, the different systems and differences in time responses of the underlying process need to be considered. Growth of fish and plants happen in hours or days and are slow processes while photosynthesis and transpiration in crops happen in seconds or minutes and are fast processes. As in a closed loop system the main water use is due to plant transpiration, the necessary sizes of system and sub-system depend on plant transpiration. We therefore aimed at creating an aquaponics-sizing simulator based on deterministic mathematical models and thus transferrable to various circumstances with simple parameterisation. We have combined a full-scale greenhouse simulator with a possible simulation time of min 1 min including HP, greenhouse construction and physics as well as a very detailed plant energy and growth model with a model for a multi-loop aquaponics system including distillation technologies and sumps. To illustrate the quality and wide applicability of our theoretical implementation of a multi-loop aquaponics system in greenhouse conditions we made scenario simulation studies at three different climate zones as sub-arctic cold, moderate and arid subtropical regions (i.e. Faroe Islands [66°N], The Netherlands [52°N], and Namibia [22.6°S]) using the same RAS size while simulating on the fitting HP area. For sizing, we used the element P as the most valuable macronutrient for plants. We simulated in a 1-min time steps for a 3-year duration using hourly input climate data for a complete year. Results clearly indicate the importance of transpiration dynamics on system and sub-system sizing, where e.g. the optimal HP size necessary was 11,250 m2, 10,250 m2 and 5250 m2 (tomato), or 15,750 m2, 14,000 m2 and 9250 m2 (lettuce), for Faroe Islands, The Netherlands, and Namibia, respectively.},

  abstract = {The sustainable development of agricultural systems where nutrients and water are recycled to a high degree is of enormous importance. Traditional aquaponics, where fish and plants are cultivated in one recirculating system, addresses these ecological challenges, but still struggles with its economical feasibility. Decoupled multi-loop aquaponics systems, in which the aquaculture and hydroponics subsystems are running autonomously, proved that they can keep up with the productivity of state-of-the-art hydroponics systems or even outscore them. Yet, a problem of such decoupled aquaponics systems was that plants require a high nutrient concentration, whereas fish prefer rather a clean water. In practice, the opposite is happening as the nutrients are added to the aquaculture units through the feed. This paper optimizes a recent approach showing that desalination technologies, such as reverse osmosis, can play an important role in reversing the concentrations within such systems without killing beneficial plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria thermally. The proposed integrated systems approach has the potential to make both periodical nutrient and water discharges and excessive fertilizer supplementation obsolete that would otherwise be necessary to maintain good water quality for the fish and an optimal nutrient solution for the plants.},

  abstract = {The classical working principle of aquaponics is to provide nutrient-rich aquacultural water to a hydroponic plant culture unit, which in turn depurates the water that is returned to the aquaculture tanks. A known drawback is that a compromise away from optimal growing conditions for plants and fish must be achieved to produce both crops and fish in the same environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to develop a theoretical concept of a decoupled aquaponic system (DAPS), and predict water, nutrient (N and P), fish, sludge, and plant levels. This has been approached by developing a dynamic aquaponic system model, using inputs from data found in literature covering the fields of aquaculture, hydroponics, and sludge treatment. The outputs from the model showed the dependency of aquacultural water quality on the hydroponic evapotranspiration rate. This result can be explained by the fact that DAPS is based on one-way flows. These one-way flows results in accumulations of remineralized nutrients in the hydroponic component ensuring optimal conditions for the plants. The study also suggests to size the cultivation area based on P availability in the hydroponic component as P is an exhaustible resource and has been identified one of the main limiting factors for plant growth.},

  abstract = {There is a recognized need for mineralizing aquaculture-derived sludge in aquaponics systems in order to reduce waste production. Many recent studies of aquacultural waste treatment have focused only the production of biogas as opposed to the potential for mineralization of nutrient-rich sludge. Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors provide one possible solution for breaking down sludge into bioavailable nutrients that can subsequently be delivered to plants. As such, this study examines the mineralization performance of sequential UASB reactors that are designed with an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) and compared to standard aerobic and anaerobic batch reactors. Results of our experiments demonstrate that only chemical oxygen demand reduction is significantly different. An unexpected drop in pH of one of the three reactor systems revealed that a pH below 6 was able to significantly increase the mineralization and mobilization of nutrients. Approximately 25\% of phosphorus, potassium, and calcium could also be recovered from the sludge under lower pH conditions, as compared to the mineralization performance of standard UASB reactors running at a higher pH. However, the opposite effect was observed with respect to organic sludge reduction, where diminished performance was observed in the low-pH reactor. The current study implies that anaerobic reactors operating at low pH can potentially contribute towards improved nutrient recovery in multi-loop aquaponics systems and reduction of additive agents for pH control of the hydroponic subsystem.},

  abstract = {There is a lot of technological buzz over the past few years regarding taking care of lettuce and hydroponic greenhouse plants and fish. We first review and discuss the recent technologies in the field of hydroponics, especially the hydroponic sensor curriculum project. The College of Engineering at The University of Akron developed a sensor that can detect hydrology, ph, electrical conductivity, nutrient levels, and temperature of hydroponic plants \& aquaponic systems. The sensor can optimize the healthy monitoring of plants and fish in greenhouses, homes, schools, and universities anywhere in the world. The goal is to provide sustainable monitoring for growing healthy greenhouse foods 24/7. In this paper, we propose a sustainable solution for optimizing plant growth by using computer simulations and smart phone applications for plant growers and fisheries to access data in real-time and provide guidance on how to manage healthy environments for plants, such as “electric conductivity is lower than the standard for the tomato, so please add 5ml of nutrients”. The app will be extended to social media connection, which is enabled by the web access features, where the user can network with hydroponic and aquarium user groups to share information (how to grow a lettuce), ask questions (where can I buy seeds), and gaming for virtual fish and plant growing. The app can be used on a computer, a smart phone or a tablet and provides numerous features that currently need many separate apps, especially in emerging areas such as hydroponics and aquaponics. The data visualization component in the app can enhance the analysis of the variables and data collection. Using the app, plant growers can track results and grow better crops. The app also provides hands-on interactive simulations that connect to the national science standards, providing optimal use of nutrients by taking care of greenhouse plants and fish for hydroponics and aquaponics.},

However, there are not enough trained specialists yet to build and operate such systems. The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of institutions of higher education – like ZHAW – can play to mitigate this deficit. ZHAW has the ability to execute applied research, teaching on BSc and MSc level, and is aiming to increase societal added value concerning education and health. Each of these levels has different demands on the aquaponic system concerning a multitude of factors, such as access, size, construction, climate control, diversity of production methods, recycling and closed loop systems, provision of energy from renewable sources and rainwater harvesting, treatment and use. To evaluate how these objectives are reached, the requirements on the system originating from each level are defined. These are used to evaluate the aquaponic system that was built and operated at ZHAW. Other aquaponic systems in use are compared to the ZHAW system, using the same evaluation criteria. The results show that the ZHAW Aquaponics Lab can reach all target levels, if the aquaponic farm of its spin-off company UrbanFarmers is viewed as an extension of it.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics, which integrates hydroponic farming and aquaculture, has the potential for sustainably producing high-quality food, but has yet to achieve commercial success. In recent years, however, commercial-scale aquaponics has received considerable attention from the scientific community, with the current literature covering many aspects of aquaponic production. We reviewed this literature and classified the specific areas covered by each paper and its contribution to either cost reduction or benefit enhancement. The literature regarding the economic benefits of aquaponics was summarised, and despite contradicting views of current profitability, there is a consensus that (i) larger systems are economically superior to smaller ones; (ii) profitability is sensitive to retail prices; and (iii) commercial aquaponics are more profitable through improved business plans. This review provides a quantitative scientific analysis of the bioeconomics and potential of commercial aquaponics, useful for both researchers and practitioners. We argue for greater focus on three understudied aspects that could each be a ‘game changer’ for commercial aquaponics. These include the following: (i) grower considerations such as financial planning and risk management that affect potential growers’ initial engagement in aquaponics; (ii) consumer perception of aquaponic products including the willingness to pay more for its added value; and (iii) the economic value of the environmental benefits of aquaponic systems and ways to internalise them for profit. Further study of each of these aspects, along with the ongoing improvement of production systems, will support the establishment of large-scale aquaponics as an economically sustainable industry.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics or the integration of aquaculture and hydroponic farming, is a sustainable food production system that is currently popular more as a hobby rather than on commercial scales. Recent increase in scientific and public interest in aquaponics and its environmental benefits supports research that addresses technical, economic, and legislative barriers to wider adoption of these systems. A successful combination of hydroponics with an aquaculture system requires high levels of knowledge and skill that are not necessarily available to all aquaponic practitioners. In this short communication, we analyzed the results of a worldwide survey of commercial aquaponic growers’ statements about their own knowledge base. Most respondents (59\%) had some relevant prior knowledge. Surprisingly, many respondents (41\%) claimed to have insufficient knowledge of both fish and plants in their first year of operating a commercial aquaponics system. We interpret this as a rough indication that about a third of the new aquaponic businesses are started by entrepreneurs who are not farmers and have no prior training or experience in growing fish or plants. If aquaponics is to become a more widespread commercially viable enterprise and be capable of delivering its environmental benefits, its promotion must consider the importance of prior knowledge held by entrepreneurs entering aquaponics.},

We find the regulatory landscape for aquaponics in respective countries has emerged in reaction to historical precedents in aquaculture and agriculture, and specific legislation on aquaponics is slow to develop. Aquaponics operations typically must meet two disparate sets of regulations. As such, it creates a complex barrier to commercial scaling up and the transition to a more sustainable circular economy. We conclude with specific policy suggestions for aquaponics, but also note larger lessons for the regulatory challenges that occur when the circular economy application attempt to bridge two or more different areas of policies.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on optimizing waste streams from land-based Atlantic Salmon fish farms in Nordic countries. Fisheries are in a transition period as global demand continues to increase and global wild catch has plateaued. In 2016, the world passed a milestone where now over half of the world's fish supply is from fish farms. Nearly three quarters of Atlantic salmon are produced in farms. As the economic costs associated with sea lice and infection increase, and recirculating aquaculture systems technology improves, firms are now moving smolt production and even the entire production process (Langsand Laks) on land. It is currently more expensive to produce fish in these systems, but firms can receive a price premium for sustainably produced fish, particularly when marketed to high-end restaurants. We are witnessing the beginning of a transition in fish production to land-based systems motivated by sustainability: maximizing fish in/fish out ratios, and thereby minimizing waste (i.e., organic residue). Options for valorization of the waste production include integrated algae systems, hydroponic systems, and centralized processing operations that return the residue into the larger bio-economy. These technologies will therefore become more important in the near future.},

  abstract = {The article touches upon the acute problems of eco-agriculture and decreasing quantity and quality of food products in large cities. The solution to the main problem of agriculture at present – namely, increasing the yield of biological products - should be obtained through the use of new technologies and modern methods of growing fish and agricultural products. Joint cultivation of different types of fish, agricultural plants and bacterial strains in a modular installation opens up enormous opportunities to make the production more efficient, to reduce the time for growing plants, and to obtain safe products. In cultivation process the waste products of farmed fish become the fertilizers for growing crops by the hydroponic method. The data on growing tilapia and strawberries in the aquaponic unit with addition of a bacterial strain are presented. In the course of the experiment there was analyzed the physiological state of tilapia: indicators of weight gain, fatness ratio. Joint cultivation of fish and plants in the unit leads to accumulating high concentrations of nitrogen compounds in plants, which not only gives the product unpleasant taste, but can also result in health problems of the end user. The accumulation of nitrates in plants reduces the diversity of farmed agricultural products. There was carried out an experiment on using bacterial isolate (bacterial strain) to reduce the proportion of nitrates in the system and accelerate the development of plants. Adding a bacterial strain to the plant reduced the level of nitrates. Besides, possessing the economically useful properties (stimulation of plant growth and development), the bacterial strain inhibited the development of pathogens. The practical value is the opportunity to get safe and environmentally friendly fish and vegetable products in a shorter time.},

  abstract = {Recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) effluent has a high concentration of nitrogen, which can be a valuable asset as fertilizer for agricultural use in the vicinity of the RAS. A novel fullyautomated experimental set-up of 24 lysimeter-plots was used to determine the optimal irrigation rate for cucumber plants fertigated with RAS effluents of three different nitrogen concentrations. Three RASs were stocked with 7, 14 and 21 kg of barramundi (Lates Calcarifer), which were fed 1.75\% of their body mass daily. Then, 10\% of the water in each RAS was exchanged daily, resulting in three nitrate–N concentrations of approximately 30, 60 and 90 mg/L. A synthetically fertilized control treatment was kept at 60 mg/L nitrate–N, and the other essential plant nutrients were kept at the same concentration for all treatments. The water from these four sources was then used to irrigate six plots per nitrate–N concentration treatment, at a rate of 1 to 6 times the amount transpired, which was measured in an automated fashion by the experimental set-up. Two yield response to nitrogen fertigation models fit well to the measured data, and although they led to different conclusions in terms of optimal fertigation can be a useful tool for decision support. The nitrogen use efficiency dropped with increased fertigation, from about 80 \% to 55 \%, and more fertigation led to an exponential increase in drainage and gaseous emissions of nitrogen. The observed data can be used to optimize irrigation for each nitrogen concentration, but the values are highly dependent on climate, plant type, and root zone characteristics, demonstrating the need for more inclusive modeling. Determination of how to optimally make use of RAS effluent water and the comparison with synthetic fertilizer can lead to the development of simplified protocols concerning integrated aquaculture agriculture systems, making it accessible to a wider range of growers.},

EEM-PARAFAC analysis was used to determine the composition of the dissolved organic matter and to study its relationship with nitrogen transformation. The composition and antioxidant activity of Stevia leaves were used as indicators of the benefits of bacterial supplementation on nutrient absorption. Two systems were used, each consisting of a circular fish tank (1.7 m3) and six units of the nutrient film (0.18 m3). One system was supplemented with bacteria (BS), while the other was used as control (NBS). The inclusion of Bacillus spp. facilitated mineralization and the availability of total phosphorus (TP), K+, and nitrogen, and also controlled the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) for 56 days without water exchange. FDOM was modeled by four components (3-humic-like, 1-protein-like), which were good indicators of the process of mineralization. The fluorescence intensity in the biofilter was significantly correlated with TP, K+, temperature, and the absorption coefficient a254. The fluorescence index (FI) was a good indicator of the process of nitrification. Plants from BS required 46.4\% less NO3– and 47.8\% less K+ compared to the control, and absorbed 45.1\% more TP. BS-Stevia leaves produced 38.6\% more reducing sugars, 28.6\% more flavonoids, and 35.9\% more glycosylated flavonoids than the control. The fish in the BS system reached a higher final weight than NBS, resulting in a 1 kg/m3 higher gross yield. Even so, it will be necessary to reduce the pH of the water to increase the antioxidant scavenging capacity of the plants.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of tomato plants to efficiently use the nitrogen (N) of a recirculation aquaponic system (RAS) and to evaluate the effects of foliar fertilization as a complement to the water nutrition on the growth of the two tomato cultivars. The significant effect of six macro- and seven micronutrients was evaluated on the plant growth and on the fruit yield. Two experiments were performed in a nutrient film aquaponic unit. The first experiment was designed to study the effects of foliar fertilization on the seedlings of two tomato cultivars Costoluto Genovese (CG) (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and Currant tomato (Ct) (Solanum pimpinellifolium) with 8\% of weekly water exchange (WE8\%-RAS). The foliar fertilizer was formulated with N restriction in the last 11 weeks (TF1). In the second experiment, two other foliar fertilization treatments (TF2 and TF3) were applied with a concentration of nutrients twice and triple that in TF1, but with a lower proportion of NPK ratio. These treatments were tested on the cultivar CG in a RAS with zero water exchange (WE0\%-RAS). The data from the 1st experiment showed a positive effect of the foliar fertilization on the yield of both cultivars. The fertilization markedly influenced the dry matter weight of the CG; however, this effect was not observed in the Ct. The root length of both cultivars was positively influenced by the P content, whereas the plant height was affected by the excess of Co and S. According to the results from the 2nd experiment, the TF2 plants had the highest number of fruits with a high mean weight. The system was efficient in utilizing N from fish tank; the water K favored the yield of the CG fruit and the foliar K favored the growth of the TF2 plants. With a decrease in the foliar N, the CG plants were able to absorb 27.5\% of the NO3− and 7.06\% of total ammonia nitrogen from water. The absolute and relative growth rate of Nile tilapia was not affected by the rate of water exchange. Fulton’s condition factor of the total length and weight curve indicated that fish from WE8\%-RAS had wider bodies than the fish from WE0\%-RAS at the same length range. Nitrate and P in the final effluent were lower than the maximum reference values allowed for the discharged water.},

  abstract = {The demand for seafood products on the global market is rising, particularly in Asia, as affluence and appreciation of the health benefits of seafood increase. This is coupled with a capture fishery that, at best, is set for stagnation and, at worst, significant collapse. Global aquaculture is the fastest growing sector of the food industry and currently accounts for approximately 45.6\% of the world’s fish consumption. However, the rapid development of extensive and semi-extensive systems, particularly intensive marine-fed aquaculture, has resulted in worldwide concern about the potential environmental, economic, and social impacts of such systems. In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research conducted on the development of sustainable saltwater-based food production systems through mechanical (e.g., recirculatory aquaculture (RAS) systems) methods and ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA)). This review article will examine the potential negative impacts of monocultural saltwater aquaculture operations and review established (RAS) and novel (IMTA; constructed wetlands; saltwater aquaponics) saltwater-based food production systems and discuss their (potential) contribution to the development of sustainable and environmentally-friendly systems.},

This phenomenon is transforming architectural practice and design techniques, moving the focus from a mechanical perspective of architecture (tectonics, construction, materiality, structure) to a biotechnical approach which attempts to equip the architect with instruments to regard buildings as living structures permanently exchanging energy with their environment. Using the environment as a creative generator for design has prompted the emergence of new aesthetic models in current architectural design. The access to new tools, together with new concerns and ways of thinking, have opened new lines of intervention that seem to affect the profession in a more fundamental way. The focus of this paper is to provide an account of these cultural constructs as experimental aesthetic systems, with the intention of not only clarifying their principles and objectives, but also reflecting on the design techniques associated to them. Ultimately, this paper provides a reflection on the role of aesthetics in sustainable design, and on the critical question: is sustainability finally becoming an intrinsic part of architecture?},

  abstract = {Infestation of gregarines from genus Nematopsis in Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei is commonly associated with a decrease in production and low weight, as well as a possible predisposition to viral infections. The goal of our past research was to evaluate the effect of the Nematopsis sp. gregarine parasitosis on the growth of farm-grown Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp. Four cages were built with PVC pipes and plastic screens with a 6mm light diameter, 1,7m in height, and 1,5m in width and length (2,23 m3), and were installed in a farm-growing area in La Pesca, Tamaulipas. Twenty-nine previously weighed shrimp, L. vannamei, were placed in each cage. These had a “2” (6 to 10 parasites per shrimp) degree of infestation severity by Nematopsis sp. The shrimp in 2 cages were fed for 5 days with the farm feed and 6g/kg of sodium monensin. The shrimp in the remaining cages were fed with commercial feed. After 5 days, the shrimp in the 4 cages were fed with a balanced feed for 38 days. After this, the biomass of each cage was recorded. The shrimp in the control cages weighed an average of 7,12g at the beginning of research and 9,27g at the end, and the treated shrimp weighed 7,09g and 9,88g, respectively. The non-treated shrimp gained 2,5g and the treated shrimp gained 2,79g. This present research shows that the negative effect on the shrimp growth caused by Nematopsis sp. infestation can be reversed if the infected shrimp are treated against infestation with sodium monensin, which possesses a therapeutic effect that eliminated the infestation without affecting the shrimp growth.},

  abstract = {Smart Aquaponic is a system of planting plants and maintaining fish in one container with integrated Internet of Things technology. Aquaponic is the process by which plants utilize nutrients derived from fish feces which, if left in the pond, will become toxic to the fish. Plants function as a filter of vegetation which will break down these toxic substances into substances that are not harmful to fish. Plants also supply oxygen to the water used to maintain fish. With this cycle there will be a mutually beneficial cycle between plants and fish. This system is very profitable, because the land used will not be too large. The purpose of this study was to develop a smart aquaponic system using Internet of Things technology. In this system aquaponics are equipped with sensors that function as monitors and actuators. Actuators can be controlled by users using smart phones. Sensor monitoring can be observed by users using smart phones. The method used in this study uses the Microsoft Solution Framework (MSF) with the waterfall system development method and Object Oriented Development (OOD) method. Stages in this study includes problem identification, preliminary planning and design, piloting and implementation. Conclusion: This smart aquaponics design is ready to be implemented in small scale trials.},

The use of an aquaponic system can improve the water quality, because the basic principle of aquaponics is to utilize fish waste and fish feed residues that are not consumed and it can be used as a nutrients for kailan, lettuce and pakcoy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the three plants can affect blood glucose levels and the level of oxygen consumption of catfish. The research method using an experimental method with a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of 4 treatments and 5 replications. At P0 are control (without plants), P1 (kailan), P2 (lettuce), and P3 (pakcoy). The main parameters observed were blood glucose levels and oxygen consumption levels. While the supporting parameters are measurement of temperature, DO, pH, plant measurements at the beginning and end of the study. The results showed that there was a significant difference (p{$<$}0.05) on blood glucose levels and oxygen consumption levels in aquaponic system cultivation. The treatment that gave the best value for blood glucose levels and oxygen consumption was the use of lettuce plants (P2).},

Vibrator-pollinated plants of each cultivar produced greater marketable yield than did blower-pollinated plants. Within cultivars, marketable yield was greater and yields of culls were lower with vibrator-pollinated plants. Fruit weight and diameter and the number of seeds per fruit were greater in vibrator-pollinated plants. Marketable yield of ‘Trust’ was greater and cull yield was lower than that of ‘Caruso’ in 1996. However, marketable yield of ‘Caruso’ was greater than that of ‘Trust’ and cull yield was about the same in 1997. Interactions between pollinating tools and cultivar were not significant except for fruit weight in 1997. The time needed to pollinate 640 plants for 13 weeks was 7.13 and 11.75 person-hours using the air blower and the electric vibrator, respectively. Labor cost for pollination was \$49.92 for the air blower and \$82.25 for the vibrator. Yield loss using the air blower for pollination was not offset by the savings in operating costs.},

This study selected 513 related documents (2000–2019) in the Web of Science database (WOS) to mine and quantitatively analyze its text data. The keyword co-occurrence network shows that the current aquaponics research mainly focuses on the system components, wastewater treatment, nutrient management, and system production. Research areas reflect obvious regional characteristics. China, the United States and Europe are dedicated to the application of new technologies, the optimization of system production, and the exploration of multiple roles. At present, the aquaponics development is facing many pressures from management and market. Future research requires more in-depth research in the system construction, nutrient management, and microbial community structure to provide a theoretical basis. Moreover, the identity construction within the conceptual framework of green infrastructure is a research direction worth exploring to solve low social recognition for aquaponics.},

  abstract = {Getting appropriate water source for fish and plant cultivation seems difficult. Moreover, the agricultural production is decreasing due to narrower lands so that land- and water-saving technology combined with a variety of vegetable is important to produce maximum yield. Aquaponics is a sustainable agriculture system in a symbiotic environment by combining aquaculture and hydroponics. This water system should flow on the planting medium periodically to ensure the plants get the nutrients, while the water can be filtered properly by the medium. This research designed a smart aquaponics system that could control and monitor the degree of acidity, water level, water temperature, and fish feed that were integrated with internet-based mobile application. In this system, there was a sensor installed to retrieve data, which was then transmitted to Ubuntu IoT Cloud server that could be accessed in real time through the internet network. Thus, the quality and water circulation were wellpreserved. Results showed that the success rate of measurement for ultrasonic sensor was 99.94\%, pH sensor of 92.35\%, and temperature sensor of 97.91\%. The temperature and pH water pool that were suitable for aquaponics ranged between 20-300C and 7-75 and the monitoring system proceeded as expected.},

  abstract = {The combination of fish and plant production in an integrated recirculation system is called Aquaponics System. In natural waters, ammonium is converted rather rapidly to nitrite and further to nitrate by aerobic bacteria from the genera Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, through a process called nitrification. Ammonia (NH3) is the waste products of the fish and extremely toxic to fish. First nitrifying process is by Nitrosomonas bacteria. Nitrosomonas bacteria is cultured in the grow beds (gravel). This bacteria feed on both oxygen' and ammonia and with their biological activities. Reaction of Nitrosomonas bacteria produces excretes a chemical called nitrite (NO2). Nitrite is toxic to fish but not toxic as ammonia. Second of nitrifying process is by Nitrobacter bacteria. Nitrobacter bacteria also cultured in the grow beds (gravel). These bacteria utilize oxygen in its respiration, acts in similar way as Nitrosomonas bacteria. Reaction of Nitrobacter bacteria have changes the nitrite into a relatively harmless chemical called nitrate (NO3). Nitrate is primary source of plant nutrition. Plants take in the converted nirates as nutrients. The nutrients are a fertilizer, feeding the plants. This system produces the clean water to fish tank and ready for next cycle. The aims of this research are to determine the characteristics of water quality from the cultured catfish (Siluriforme) tank, to determine effect of vegetable (Ipomoea aquatic) distribution on the wastewater quality and effect of the vegetable (Ipomoea aquatic) growth. The results found the ideal range of temperature 27.92°C to 29.14°C and ideal range of pH 6.50- 6.94. The temperature and pH in fish tank in controlled conditions.},

Research on the improvement of polyculture water quality in aquaponics system was conducted from July 2014 to August 2014. This study aims to improve the water quality in Nile tilapia and catfish polyculture by applying the aquaponics system. The results show that several water quality parameters increase, such as dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and nitrate. Meanwhile, Orthophosphate tends to be similar both in aquaponics system and control. The study is conducted experimentally by using completely randomized design. The cultured fish are catfish and Nile tilapia while the aquatic plants are water spinach and lettuce. At the end of the study the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the aquaponics system ranges from 5.3 to 7.6 mg/L, while in the media control ranges from 4.2 to 4.3 mg/L. Average concentrations of ammonia, nitrate and orthophosphate in the aquaponics system range from 0.003 to 0.25 mg/L, 10.0 to 50.7 mg/L and 3.0 mg/L-5.0 mg/L respectively. Meanwhile, in media control, concentration of those three parameters are 0.003 to 0.35 mg/L, 10.0 to 60.0 mg/L and 3.0 to 5.0 mg/L respectively. Based on this study, it is concluded that the polyculture water quality can be improved through the application of the aquaponics system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic systems are sustainable solutions for food production combining fish growth (aquaculture) and production of vegetables (hydroponic) in one recirculating system. In aquaponics, nitrogen-enriched wastewater from fish in the aquaculture serves as fertilizer for the plants in the hydroponics, while the nitrogen-depleted and detoxified water flows back to the aquaculture. To investigate bacterial nitrogen-cycling in such an aquaponic system, measurements of nitrogen species were coupled with time-resolved 16S rRNA gene profiling and the functional capacity of organisms was studied using metagenomics. The aquaponic system was consistently removing ammonia and nitrite below 23 µM and 19 µM, and nitrate to steady-state concentrations of about 0.5 mM. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of sediments exposed in the pump sump revealed that typical signatures of canonical ammonia-oxidising microorganisms were below detection limit. However, one of the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTU) was classified as a member of the genus Nitrospira with a relative abundance of 3.8\%. For this genus, also genome scaffolds were recovered encoding the only ammonia monooxygenase genes identified in the metagenome. This study indicates that even in highly efficient aquaponic systems, comammox Nitrospira were found to participate in ammonium removal at low steady-state ammonia concentrations.},

  location = {{S.l.}},
  abstract = {In this thesis, the responses of tomato crop growth and yield to greenhouse climate (light, temperature and C0 2 concentration) and crop management (plant density and fruit pruning) were analysed and quantified. A simulation model, TOMSIM, was developed, using existing explanatory crop growth models for tomato, and validated.Sink demand, influenced by fruit pruning (retaining two to seven fruits per truss), did not influence dry matter production per unit of intercepted radiation. Measurements in daylit phytotron compartments showed an increase in crop photosynthesis with 17\%, when C0 2 concentration increased from 500 to 900 micro-mol mol -1. Based on periodic destructive measurements in 12 experiments, a crop efficiency of 2.5 g dry matter MJ -1PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) was observed. At the end of most experiments, 54-60\% of total dry matter produced was partitioned into the fruits and the ratio between produced leaf and stem dry weight was 7:3. For late autumn plantings, only 35-38\% was partitioned into the fruits, owing to poor fruit set. From first harvest onwards, an (almost) constant partitioning existed: 70\% of dry matter was distributed to the fruits, when the number of fruits per truss was seven.Dry matter partitioning was strongly influenced by the number of fruits on the plant. Generative sink strength appeared to be proportional to the number of fruits per truss (two to seven fruits per truss). Temperature (18-24°C) and assimilate supply (varied by plant density, 1.6-3.1 plants m -2) had no direct influence on dry matter partitioning. In double-shoot plants, where either all trusses were removed from one shoot or every other truss was removed from both shoots at anthesis, dry matter partitioning was the same, supporting the assumption of one common assimilate pool, i.e. no influence of phloern transport resistance on partitioning.In TOMSIM, potential crop growth rate is simulated, based on leaf photosynthesis rate, crop light interception, maintenance respiration rate (R m ) and conversion efficiency from carbohydrates to structural dry matter. The canopy is assumed to be composed of leaves with identical photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics. Dry matter partitioning is simulated based on the sink strengths of the plant organs, where sink strength of an organ is described by its potential growth rate. The model was validated thoroughly, both at the level of submodels and as a whole, using independent experimental data as well as measurements on commercially grown crops. In general, model predictions agreed well with the measurements. Simulated crop growth appeared to be very sensitive to LAI simulation, especially at low LAI. At low light intensity and/or high crop biomass, crop growth rate was underestimated, most likely as a result of overestimation of R m under these conditions. Simulation results improved, when R m was related to crop metabolic activity, described by crop relative growth rate. The simulation of specific leaf area, flower and/or fruit abortion and R m requires more investigation. The possibility of generalisation of the model to other (greenhouse) crops, and the possible applications of the model in supporting grower's decisions, in research and in education are discussed.},

  abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the di culty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then speciÿc to a particular treatment e ect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment e ect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the 2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random e ects meta-analysis to the standard error of a ÿxed e ect meta-analytic estimate, and I 2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in ÿve example data sets showing di erent amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I 2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth, feed efficiency, biofloc composition and water quality of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) in monoculture and polyculture with giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man, 1906) in BFT and RAS, over a period of 30 days. Fish (n = 128; 7.29 ± 0.67 g) were distributed randomly in 16 experimental tanks (8 fish/tank). Prawn (n = 96; 0.50 ± 0.09 g) were allocated in 8 experimental tanks (12 prawn/tank) in a polyculture. The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments with four replicates each, in a factorial design 2 9 2 (BFT and RAS vs. monoculture and polyculture). The experimental diet (28\% of digestible protein; 3100 kcal kg-1 of digestible energy) was used both to fish and prawn in BFT and RAS. There was significant effect (p \textbackslash{} 0.01) of the system and the culture for weight gain, apparent feed conversion and protein efficiency ratio. The average weight gain and apparent feed conversion of tilapia in monoculture (30.04 g and 1.39) and in polyculture (36.44 g and 1.27) were superior (p \textbackslash{} 0.01) in BFT than in monoculture (23.64 g and 1.74) and in polyculture (24.14 g and 1.61) in RAS. Weight gain and survival of giant freshwater prawn was superior (p \textbackslash{} 0.01) in BFT (0.43 g and 87\%) compared to RAS (0.26 g and 79\%). The data showed that BFT provides better growth performance responses in monoculture for Nile tilapia and in polyculture with giant freshwater prawn compared to RAS.},

However, disenfranchisement from ancestral lands and traditional food sources as a result of colonization led to Native Hawaiians being forced to abandon many of their traditional practices. Today, many Native Hawaiians experience food insecurity, placing them at further risk for obesity and other nutrition-related chronic diseases. Consequently, there is a growing need for place-based and culturally relevant strategies rooted in Hawaiian epistemology to address these issues. This paper describes the history and development of one such intervention – the MALAMA study – in the community of Waimānalo that innovatively merges the modern technology of aquaponics with traditional Native Hawaiian practices and values.},

The study focuses on an aquaponics case study to show that the negative externalities borne from intensive fish farming can be internalized without regulatory intervention through a combination of fish farming and hydroponics. The introduction of aquaponics diversified the farmers’ sources of income, yielded savings in the cost of water purification and the cost of fertilizer for the plants’ growth, and resulted in more fish and plant output compared to the unregulated scenario. While deriving these results, we also derive a separation rule for managing live aquatic inventory, which separates expenses (which are affected by the biology of fish) and income.},

Goals of these policies that are related to aquaponics include promoting innovation, increasing competitiveness and sustainability, improving access to space and water, welfare of fish, prevention of waste, and promoting resource-efficiency and low-carbon economy. Aquaponics contributes to achieving these goals by minimising water and nutrient use, utilising areas unfit for other food production systems, facilitating local food production and thus providing new business opportunities. The EU provides various frameworks for financial support for the different components of aquaponics, resulting in a range of opportunities for the newcomer as well as the already established aquaponics entrepreneurs. Financial support mostly targets research projects, while the sector also needs assistance in the commercial development.},

The objective of this study is to compare flood-and- drain, and the water crossflow system and examine the differences in the water quality, fish yield and plant growth parameters for Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and basil (Ocimum basilicum). During the study, water quality parameters of two treatments were compared in temperatures, pH, EC and NO3¯N were significantly different (p{$<$}0.05). Leaf area of the basil plants grew to an average of 20.37 cm2 (±9.02 cm2). The plants’ biomass production was significantly different (p{$<$}0.05) in the two systems. The biomass production showed lower yield, 458.22 g (±214.59 g) in the constant flow system that in the flood- and- drain system 692.9 g (±175.82 g). Fish Growth parameters were better in constant flow system (FCR 5.48 g/g ± 0.19). However, the specific growth rate (SGR) demonstrated that fish grew faster in flood- and- drain system 1.38 \%/day (±0.29).},

Indian spinach was planted at four densities (4 plants/m2, 8 plants/m2, 12 plants/m2 and 16 plants/m2). Stocking density of Nile tilapia (Av. body wt. 32.5 g) was 45 fish/tank (water capacity 300 L) in all planting densities. The highest weight gain, percent weight gain, specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio of fish were obtained at planting density of 12 plants/m2. Feed conversion ratio was also lowest at this density. Number of leaves per plant, plant length, plant weight and yield of Indian spinach were the highest at 12 plants/m2. It was concluded that the plant density of 12 plants/m2, for Indian spinach integrated with 45 fish/tank was suitable for production of both vegetable and Nile tilapia in a recirculating aquaponics system.},

Moreover, 10000 kg greenhouse tomato production considered as Functional Unit (FU) in this research. The results of LCA revealed that AD, AC, EP, OLD, HT, FE, ME, TE and PO were 33.14 kg Sb eq., 17.79 kg SO2 eq., 4.56 kg PO-3 4 eq., 3409.76 kg CO2 eq., 0.00017 kg CFC11 eq., 2215.59 kg 1,4-DB eq., 827.44 kg 1,4DB eq., 2330861.74 kg 1,4-DB eq., 14.69 kg 1,4-DB eq. and 0.88 kg C2H4 eq. for 10000 kg greenhouse tomato production, respectively. The highest share of emission in most environmental impacts belonged to diesel fuel and On-Farm emissions. CExD analysis used for determination of different energy form indices and its results indicated that Nonrenewable, fossil with 39624.78 MJ was the highest energy consumer index; followed by renewable water 23140.21 MJ for 10000 kg of greenhouse tomato production. Finally, it is suggested that applying solar technologies for replacing renewable energy in heating of tomato greenhouses instead of diesel fuel consumption in production process.},

This study evaluates the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on tilapia growth and muscle tissue composition, especially the ability of tilapia to retain omega-3 fatty acids, raised in aquaponics system. Tilapia were fed linseed oil (LO) and sunflower oil (SO) supplemented feeds for 12 weeks and growth was measured at 0, 6, and 12 weeks. Omega-3 muscle tissue retention was measured at 12 weeks. The condition factor significantly increased between 6 and 12 weeks for both LO and SO. At week 12 the condition factor of the negative control (NC) was significantly lower than both LO and SO. LO retained more of some omega-3 fatty acids than SO, however they were not significantly different using either method. NC had higher total omega-3 values than LO and SO according to both methods; however NC also had the highest saturated and total fat. This study determined that increasing fatty acids in the diet resulted in increased growth and a healthier body composition overall for tilapia; however it did not conclusively determine the effect of supplementation on omega-3 retention.},

  abstract = {Anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation), which is a reaction that oxidizes ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor under anoxic conditions, was an important discovery in the nitrogen cycle. The reaction is mediated by a specialized group of planctomycete-like bacteria that were first discovered in man-made ecosystems. Subsequently, many studies have reported on the ubiquitous distribution of anammox bacteria in various natural habitats, including anoxic marine sediments and water columns, freshwater sediments and water columns, terrestrial ecosystems and some special ecosystems, such as petroleum reservoirs. Previous studies have estimated that the anammox process is responsible for 50\% of the marine nitrogen loss. Recently, the anammox process was reported to account for 9–40\% and 4–37\% of the nitrogen loss in inland lakes and agricultural soils respectively. These findings indicate the great potential for the anammox process to occur in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. The distribution of different anammox bacteria and their contribution to nitrogen loss have been described in different natural habitats, demonstrating that the anammox process is strongly influenced by the local environmental conditions. The present mini-review summarizes the current knowledge of the ecological distribution of anammox bacteria, their contribution to nitrogen loss in various natural ecosystems and the effects of major influential factors on the anammox process.},

  abstract = {In 2019, the degree of food self-support in Taiwan was 32.08\%, which was lower than that in the previous year by 2.4\%. Taiwan does not have the ability to control the availability of food in the face of a food crisis. This study used an aquaponics system to implement the mutualism of fish, flowers, vegetables, and water, as well as to implement the cyclic utilization of water, so that vegetables and fruit could be produced to relieve food shortages in the world. The simulation site of this study was located on a gentle grassy slope alongside Li-tze Lake in Changhua County, Taiwan. In the simulation, three light-tight experimental buckets, with an upper rim diameter of 130 cm, a bottom rim diameter of 125 cm, and a height of 180 cm, were embedded in the ground. The target vegetables and flowers were planted in pots at 17 cm apart, and they were planted on the water surface using the floating island principle. A solar power system enabled a motorized pump to irrigate the plants. An aerator provided adequate aeration to achieve an elementary purifying effect. The experimental results showed that, in terms of the dissolved oxygen, the mean difference of the experimental group was about 1 mg/L, that of the control group was 2 mg/L, and the maximum difference was 6.5 mg/L. As the fish died in April, the ammonia nitrogen value of the control group was 68 times higher than that of the experimental group. Due to the nitrification in July, the ammonia nitrogen decomposed into NO2, which suddenly increased to 13 mg/L and was extremely unsuitable for the existence of aquatic organisms. This amount was five to six times higher than that of the experimental group. In terms of the fish growth rate, the control group could not bear the drastic changes in the water body at the intermediate stage, and all the fish died, whereas the fish in the experimental group were not affected. The results of this study could provide useful data for gardening, aquatic products, and space design staff.},

  abstract = {The development of anaerobic digestion (AD) for volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production from waste activated sludge (WAS) is arrested due to low hydrolysis and acidification efficiency. This study proposed to enhance WAS reduction and VFAs accumulation during AD process via bioaugmentation of acetate-producing bacteria. Four acetogens were firstly isolated from a temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD) system. The acetate production efficiency of different isolates ranged from 15.8 to 73.7 mg acetate/g TOC, in which the bacterial strain NJUST19 was found to be the most effective strain. The results of morphological, biochemical charac­ teristics as well as phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate NJUST19 was Gram-positive and rod-shaped, catalase-negative, nitrate reduction-positive, methyl red-negative and capable of starch and gelatin hydrolysis, for which the name of Clostridium sp. NJUST19 was proposed. The optimal culture conditions (i.e. initial pH and temperature) were evaluated for their effects on microbe growth of selected NJUST19, and the maximum acetate production was observed at pH 9.0 and temperature of 40 �C. In the case of modified TPAD system inoculated with Clostridium sp. NJUST19, total suspended solids (TSS) removal rate and maximum VFAs accumulation increasing to 35.3\% and 4200 mg/L, respectively, which was much higher than that of control (21.9\% and 2894 mg/L). These results indicated that Clostridium sp. NJUST 19 is capable of enhancing digestion efficiency with a great benefit for VFAs production, offering potential prospects for bioaugmentation of WAS anaerobic digestion.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen transformations in aquaponics with different edible plant species, i.e., tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and pak choi (Brassica campestris L. subsp. chinensis) were systematically examined and compared. Results showed that nitrogen utilization efficiencies (NUE) of tomato- and pak choi-based aquaponic systems were 41.3\% and 34.4\%, respectively. The abundance of nitrifying bacteria in tomato-based aquaponics was 4.2-folds higher than that in pak choi-based aquaponics, primarily due to its higher root surface area. In addition, tomato-based aquaponics had better water quality than that of pak choi-based aquaponics. About 1.5–1.9\% of nitrogen input were emitted to atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N2O) in tomato- and pak choi-based aquaponic systems, respectively, suggesting that aquaponics is a potential anthropogenic source of N2O emission. Overall, this is the first intensive study that examined the role plant species played in aquaponics, which could provide new strategy in designing and operating an aquaponic system.},

A total of 1000 post-larvae of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were distributed in boxes of 1.000 liters of water inside greenhouse. The experimental of plant growth was assembled according to a completely randomized design with two treatments: Treatment 1, cultivation of basil (Origanum basilicum), and Treatment 2, cultivation of marjoram (Origanum majorana), with three repetition. For the cultivation, the plants were placed in a platform. During the 42 days of experiments it was observed significant difference in weight and growth of basil compared to marjoram. The effluent from the cultivation of fish can be used in cultivation of basil and marjoram in aquaponic systems, allowing a favorable growth of the plants.},

  abstract = {The growing world population combined with the growing demand for water imposes enormous pressure on the sectors involved in food production. Sustainability is no longer a political or moral flag, sustentability has become a necessity. Aquaponics has been predominantly spread throughout the world through household-scale producers. Aquaponics is a method of producing food that involves the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics in recirculating systems for water and nutrients. Furthermore, Aquaponics presents itself as a real alternative for the production of food with reduced impact to the environment for its sustainability characteristics. Thus, Aquaponics is among the sustainable techniques involving fish and vegetable integrated production, capable of benefiting both. This integration allows the plant to use the nutrients from the water provided by the fish, thus improving water quality.},

  abstract = {A aquaponia é uma modalidade de cultivo de alimentos que envolve a integração entre a  aquicultura e a hidroponia em sistemas de recirculação de água e nutrientes. A aquaponia  apresenta-se como alternativa para a produção de peixes e hortaliças com as principais vantagens  de utilizar pouca água, possibilitar a produção de alimentos em ambientes urbanos e em sistemas  super intensivos, aproveitar integralmente insumos como água e ração, diversificar a produção  rural, minimizar os riscos de contaminação química e biológica e introdução de espécies  exógenas a aqüíferos; e com as principais desvantagens de apresentar um alto grau de  dependência em energia elétrica, ser muito limitada quanto ao uso de defensivos agrícolas e  antibióticos, obrigar o produtor a ter conhecimento em muitas áreas da engenharia como  hidráulica, olericultura, veterinária e zootecnia, apresentar altos custos de investimento inicial e  contar com pouca tecnologia difundida no Brasil.  No presente experimento buscou-se verificar  os efeitos de quatro tratamentos diferentes em relação à densidade de tilápias (Oreochromis  niloticus) sob uma taxa de alimentação diária proporcionalmente constante de 5\% do peso vivo  dos peixes no desenvolvimento de uma população constante de 150 espécimes de manjericão  (Ocimum basilicum) e 150 espécimes de manjerona (Origanum majorana). Os resultados do  experimento confirmaram a hipótese inicial de que a medida que a densidade de peixes aumenta  e conseqüentemente a entrada de nutrientes na forma de ração, o rendimento das plantas na  forma de crescimento vertical, ganho de peso, tempo para atingir o tamanho comercial e ausência  de sintomas de deficiência nutricional nas plantas também aumenta. Com relação aos  parâmetros de água, também como previsto, a medida que as densidades de peixes aumentam, o  pH decai e a condutividade elétrica aumenta. Outra aferição importante foi a confirmação do  processo de nitrificação da amônia ocorrido principalmente nos filtros biológicos e nas mesas de  hidroponia.  As informações do presente estudo demonstram a viabilidade técnica da aquaponia e  comprovam que a alta densidade de peixes proporcionou melhor desenvolvimento das plantas  7    manjerona e manjericão, indicando assim que a densidade inicial de estocagem de 500 g/m³ é a  mais eficiente das densidades testadas. As informações desse estudo poderão nortear novos  experimentos vinculados a aquaponia, incentivando o desenvolvimento de metodologias  ecoeficientes com capacidade na piscicultura e na olericultura de forma sustentável, além de  fornecer ao mercado consumidor produtos de alta qualidade. Mais pesquisas em aquaponia  precisam ser realizadas para comprovar a possibilidade sugerida no experimento de que os  sistemas comportam e trabalham com maior eficiência com densidades de peixes ainda mais  altas.},

The experiment was carried out on randomized block design and comprised four fish densities (0, 150, 250 and 500 fish m-3) and two crops, in which each treatment was continued for 45 days and replicated three times. Except for pH and total alkalinity, all water physicochemical parameters were increased significantly at high fish densities. In contrast, most of the biological parameters for fish were unaffected by culture density, although at the highest density crude protein percentage was significantly increased and ether extract percentage was significantly reduced. Plant productivities were highest when fish were cultured at density of 500 fish m-3, a density that was found to be appropriate for maintaining water quality and promoting fish growth while preventing toxicity and mortality. The present study has demonstrated the technical viability of coupling Nile tilapia culture coup with aquaponic production of marjoram and sweet basil.},

  abstract = {The experiment was aimed at standardization of water flow rate in aquaponic system in order to correlate nutrient removal and water quality with growth of Cyprinus carpio var. koi (koi carp fingerlings) and Beta vulgaris var. bengalensis (spinach). Different flow rates, i.e., 3.2, 1.5, and 1.0 l min-1, were assigned as treatments T1, T2, and T3, respectively, with spinach plants (28 plant m-2), whereas S1 and S2 were the treatments having flow rates of 1.5 and 1.0 l min-1, respectively, without plants. Control (C) was set at flow rates of 3.2 l min-1 without plants. Treatment T2 (1.5 l min-1) showed highest weight gain of koi carp fingerlings and also height gain of spinach plants as compared to other treatments. There was no significant difference in length gain, percentage weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, feed efficiency ratio, and protein efficiency ratio as compared to other treatments and control. All the treatments, T1, T2, and T3, effectively remove nitrate (77–78 \%), phosphate (47.04–55.06 \%), and potassium (22.85–29.16 \%) from fish effluent tanks. These results suggest that flow rates 3.2, 1.5, and 1.0 l min-1 were effective under aquaponic system. Of which, 1.5 l min-1 can be suggested as optimum water flow rate for the growth of spinach and koi carp in aquaponic system as percentage weight gain in fish, percentage height gain, and yield of plants were higher compared to flow rates 3.2 and 1.0 l min-1.},

  abstract = {Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR, also referred to as quantitative RT-PCR or RT-qPCR) is a highly sensitive and highthroughput method used to study gene expression. Despite the numerous advantages of RT-qPCR, its accuracy is strongly influenced by the stability of internal reference genes used for normalizations. To date, few studies on the identification of reference genes have been performed on cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). Therefore, we selected 26 candidate reference genes mainly via the three following channels: reference genes used in previous studies on cassava, the orthologs of the most stable Arabidopsis genes, and the sequences obtained from 32 cassava transcriptome sequence data. Then, we employed ABI 7900 HT and SYBR Green PCR mix to assess the expression of these genes in 21 materials obtained from various cassava samples under different developmental and environmental conditions. The stability of gene expression was analyzed using two statistical algorithms, namely geNorm and NormFinder. geNorm software suggests the combination of cassava4.1\_017977 and cassava4.1\_006391 as sufficient reference genes for major cassava samples, the union of cassava4.1\_014335 and cassava4.1\_006884 as best choice for drought stressed samples, and the association of cassava4.1\_012496 and cassava4.1\_006391 as optimal choice for normally grown samples. NormFinder software recommends cassava4.1\_006884 or cassava4.1\_006776 as superior reference for qPCR analysis of different materials and organs of drought stressed or normally grown cassava, respectively. Results provide an important resource for cassava reference genes under specific conditions. The limitations of these findings were also discussed. Furthermore, we suggested some strategies that may be used to select candidate reference genes.},

Both thermophilic and mesophilic sludge of treated swine waste were seeded to the digestion tank. During the 150-day startup period, coffee grounds as a main food waste, along with potato, kelp and boiled beans, tofu, bean curd lees, and deep-fried bean curd were fed to the digestion process step-by-step (max. 40 t/d). Finally, the methane yield reached 360 m3/t-feed with 40 days’ retention time, although temporary accumulation of propionate was observed. Eubacterial communities that formed in the thermophilic digestion tank differed greatly from both thermophilic and mesophilic types of seed sludge. Results suggest that the Actinomyces/Thermomonospora and Ralstonia/ Shewanella were contributors for hydrolyzation and degradation of food waste into volatile fatty acids. Acetate-utilizing methanogens, Methanosaeta, were dominant in seed sludges of both types, but they decreased drastically during processing in the digestion tank. Methanosarcina and Methanobrevibacter/ Methanobacterium were, respectively, possible main contributors for methane production from acetate and H2 plus CO2.},

  abstract = {Floating Treatment Wetlands (FTWs) are considered the most applicable and cost effective instrument for aquatic pollutant removal. This aquaponic–based bioremediation has become a potential alternative solution since inorganic (physical and chemical) treatment is seen to be ineffective for large–scale polluted objects. Numerous investigations have proved that FTWs are potential to decrease major pollutant concentration in water e.g., nitrogen, phosphate, as well as heavy metals. This treatment is applicable by using different macrophytes species. Depending on its pollutant target, the use of macrophytes will vary to its pollutant which will be removed. There are only limited reports available relating to application of macrophytes as pollutant removal applied in Indonesia. Citarum watershed is known as one of the most polluted aquatic area in Indonesia. It urgently needs a suitable method of water pollutant removal in this area. This paper aims to describe the application of FTWs as one of remediation methods that harnesses a significant potential because of its low-cost, eco-friendly, and sustainable nature for water restoration.},

  abstract = {The harvesting of plant biomass is usually implemented as an effective tool for plant management and removing the nutrients absorbed in plant tissues. Here, the influence of harvesting different biomasses (50\%, 33\%, 25\%, and 0\% (no harvest)) of watercress (Nasturtium officinale) was investigated in integrated recirculating aquaponic systems (IRASs) for rearing common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Twelve independent IRASs were designed (4 × 3); each system consisted of a fish rearing tank, a waste collection tank, and a hydroponic bed. Water quality parameters and the growth of both fish and plants were measured in all the systems, and then the nutrient removal capacities of the hydroponic beds were calculated. The results revealed that increasing the biweekly harvested biomass of the plants decreased the growth of the watercress, while it did not affect the growth of the common carp. Increasing the harvested biomass of the plants also decreased the nitrate nitrogen and orthophosphate removal efficiencies of the aquaponic systems, while it did not affect the ammonia and nitrite nitrogen removal efficiencies. Therefore, a biweekly harvesting of less than 25\% of the biomass of the growing watercress is recommended for efficient nutrient removal and the sustainable growth of both watercress and the common carp in aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {As the human population has exceeded 7 billion, consumption of animal products is at an all time high. Most of our commercial fish stocks are overexploited, recovering, or depleted, so we have turned to aquaculture to produce fish and other seafood for human consumption. Currently, about half of all seafood marketed for human consumption is a product of aquaculture. The idea of combining aquaculture and hydroponics has increased in popularity. This method, called aquaponics, uses the water from fish pools to grow plants in a controlled environment. The waste from the fish is converted to nutrients for the plants. The plants filter the water for the fish. Aquaponics is a sustainable way to produce fish proteins and fruits or vegetables for human consumption. As a science professor teaching a non-majors science course entitled Conservation and the Environment at Herkimer College in Herkimer, NY, I felt it was my responsibility to make my students more interested and aware of their environment. One way I did this was by assigning an aquaponics project among other aquaponics activities. Aquaponics appealed to a wide variety of students because it is based on science, but also has important business and economic value. Students generally not interested in careers in science were educated on an innovative type of farming. Education is the key to awareness and action. Educating community college students on aquaponics is one step in helping to keep our fish populations plentiful and our world healthy and sustainable.},

Bacillus as gut probiotic significantly enhances growth, immune response, and disease resistance in several aquatic cultured organisms. The supplementation of Bacillus as pond probiotics or bioremediator aids to improve water quality by degrading the organic detritus and reducing the nitrogenous waste. Several species of Bacillus also act as quorum-quenching bacteria that can degrade AHL (N-acyl homoserine lactones), which is responsible for the expression of virulence factor mediated by quorum sensing in several aquatic Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. This article reviews the application and mode of action of Bacillus as probiotic, bioremediator, bioaugmenter, and quorum-quenching bacteria in aquaculture. The review, further discusses the modes of delivery of Bacillus, its interaction with other beneficial microbes, and its integration into various aquaculture systems such as recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), biofloc, and aquaponics.},

The waste heat from the turbines, which are roughly 15 m from the greenhouse, is used as the main heat source for the greenhouse in the winter months, and to desalinate water when heating is not required. Recovery of this waste heat increases the energy efficiency of the four 30-kW turbines from about 25\% to 75\%. Within the greenhouse, aquaculture and hydroponic crop production are coupled by recycling the aquaculture effluent as a nutrient source for the plants. Both the sludge resulting from the filtered effluent and the inedible biomass from harvested plants are vermicomposted (i.e., rather than being sent to the landfill), resulting in marketable products such as soil amendments and liquid plant fertilizer. If suitably cleaned of contaminants, the CO2 from the landfill gas may be used to enrich the plant growing area within the greenhouse to increase the yield of the edible products. Landfill gas from the BCRRC site has successfully been processed to recover liquid commercial grade CO2 and contaminant-free methane–CO2, with the potential for this gas mixture to be applied as a feedstock for fuel cells or for methanol production. Carbon dioxide from the turbine exhaust may also be recovered for greenhouse enrichment. Alternatively, algal culture may be used to assimilate CO from the turbine exhaust into biomass, which may then 2 be used as a biofuel, or possibly as fish feed, thus making the system more self-contained. By recycling energy and materials, the system described would displace fossil fuel use, mitigating negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions, and generate less waste in need of disposal. Successful implementation of the coupled landfill (gas-to-energy · aquaponic · desalination) system would particularly benefit developing regions, such as those of the Greater Caribbean Basin.},

  abstract = {Demographic movements forecasted by the United Nations indicates that, over the next few decades greater portion of people will be concentrated in and around large cities of the world. Such population dynamics in parallel with emerging phenomena such as global pandemics and impact of climate change are posing threats to the supply chain of agricultural production. The reliance on traditional open-field cultivation and transportation of fresh products to distant urban locations are coming under threat. This has been further exposed by the current pandemic (Covid-19) that is impeding farm production along with movement of people and goods. A viable solution lies in vertical in-door farming driven by advanced technologies. The use of high-tech solutions to grow vegetables, fruits and flowers close to consumption centers has taken off successfully in many locations around the world. However, majority of such projects have been set up by investors; with access to substantial capital. In order to mitigate the possibilities of food shortages in densely populated cities, initiatives need to be undertaken to foster growth of large-scale entrepreneurship by individuals that can venture into this field on a smaller scale and with less capital outlay.},

But traditional farming has drawbacks of being dependent on soil quality, climate conditions, chemical fertilizers and pesticides water. To overcome the problems of traditional farming problem there is one technique called Aquaponics which is combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. Aquaculture deals with growing of fish and hydroponics deals with growing of soilless plants by providing with necessary nutrients. Aquaponics system which will provide natural food for the country. It will provide fish as well as plants too for humans. As using this technique water is reused, it requires less space, user gets natural food. Aquaponics can be automatically managed and controlled by making use of IOT technology with the help of sensors like pH, temperature and humidity, dissolved solvents, water level sensors. Operating the sensors on microcontrollers like NodeMCU and Arduino UNO whose reading can be obtained on Blink application for monitoring purpose. This technique can be built indoor as well as outdoor system. Sensors reading can be further used for research purpose.},

  title = {Building {{Integrated Technical Food Systems}}},
  author = {Jenkins, Andrew},
  date = {2018},
  institution = {{Queen’s University Belfast}},
  abstract = {For millennia, food has been grown within, or immediately adjacent to cities.  However, as cities increased in size, they quickly outgrew their native hinterlands  and began to import food from elsewhere to sustain their ever-growing urban populations. Today, the importation of food from around the globe is commonplace, and it is estimated that a quarter of all food grown for human consumption is traded  each year globally (D’Odorico, et al., 2014). As a result of this, food production has been pushed further and further away from urban centres. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to bring back this ancient practice when the reliance on imported food is no longer an option. During the second world war, the UK government created the ‘Dig for Victory’ campaign; encouraging citizens to plant crops in their gardens and local parks to subsidise the provision of food that would have otherwise been  imported from Europe or the USA. More recently, in Cuba, the growing of food within cities has become a proven practice once again as a method to secure sustenance  for urban populations in response to complications relating to the importation of food.  By 2050, it is anticipated that food production will need to increase by 70 percent in developed countries and 100 percent in developing countries, when referring to production values of 2005 through to 2007 (Bruinsma, 2009). However, in countries such as the UK, where there is little to no available land for additional food production, and only marginal gains available as a result of improved methods of agricultural intensification, it is the city that is considered by many to be the future  context of increased food production. In high-density cities such as London,  Manchester and Birmingham, available space is in short supply at ground-level,  which has been an essential commodity for successful transitions to urban  agriculture in recent history. As a result, the focus turns towards the surface area of the buildings that form today’s cities, and the internal floors that lay within them, as the future locations of increased food production through the use of ‘technical food systems’. Technical food systems utilise man-made components such as plastic trays and mechanical pumps to grow crops directly in water, without the use of soil, and promise increased productivity, as well as decreased water and energy use  when compared with traditional agricultural systems. Some see urban agriculture as the solution to increasing both domestic and global food production to mitigate such  problems as hunger, ecological damage and global food transport. However, to  others, it is seen as a design trend that offers no realistic alternative to the global  food system as it exists today. Thus, there are conflicting opinions as to the impact  urban agriculture could have on domestic food production, global food security and  the mitigation of ecological damage.  At first glance urban agriculture offers some obvious benefits over traditional  agricultural practices such as the growing of food in areas that are already  developed, which reduces the need to cultivate land elsewhere, and the growing of food where demand is highest, which can lead to reductions in food transport,  packaging and storage - i.e. chilling and freezing. However, in the developed world the practice of urban agriculture is advertised, so to speak, as a succession of  purpose-built edifices filled with lettuces or livestock. In many ways, this weakens  the argument for agricultural cities as an alternative to current food production  methods because it illustrates a practice that is dependent on substantial investment and the demolition of existing buildings to succeed. Within this thesis, these large utopian agricultural skyscrapers are pushed to one side, and existing buildings within existing cities become the focus. The generalised question of ‘how much food  can urban agriculture produce?’ is repurposed and more accurately posed as ‘how much food can urban agriculture produce within or upon existing buildings as part of today’s cities?’.   The delivery of the thesis is not dependent on a pre-existing hypothesis that urban  agriculture does or does not impact domestic food production. Instead, it relies on  the design of real-world experiments, the development of simulated analysis and the construction of logical arguments to determine the differing impacts of urban  agriculture in the most objective way possible. Although the thesis focuses on the contribution UK cities can make to food production, it does so by firstly  understanding the challenges that face the integration of urban agriculture. Only by achieving this understanding can the productive capacity of all UK cities be more accurately calculated, and the possible benefits of urban agriculture such as job creation and improvement in urban wellbeing be quantified and qualified. Ultimately,  the thesis focuses on a lineage of inquiry that aims to quantify the impacts of urban agriculture through the construction of a working building-integrated aquaponic  system, the light capture analysis of urban centres and the calculation and  postulation of possible additional benefits to urban populations.},

With 87 percent of people in developed regions estimated to be living in cities by 2050 it can be assumed that the majority of this localised production will occur in and around cities. As part of a 12 month engagement, Queen’s University Belfast designed and implemented an elevated aquaponic food system spanning the top internal floor and exterior roof space of a disused mill in Manchester, England. The experimental aquaponic system was developed to explore the possibilities and difficulties associated with integrating food production with existing buildings. This paper utilises empirical research regarding crop growth from the elevated aquaponic system and extrapolates the findings across a whole city. The resulting research enables the agricultural productive capacity of today’s cities to be estimated and a framework of implementation to be proposed.},

One of the bottlenecks  that limit the development of this industry is the time required for most of the  cultured fish species to reach the commercial size. The regulatory system  controlling fish growth is now much better understood and we should take  advantage of this knowledge to apply it to fish culture production. Recent  advances on the role of growth hormone (GH) and the insulin-like growth  factors (IGFs) axis, and its relationship with anabolic and proteolytic systems,  involved in remodelling of fish muscle, will be reviewed in different in vivo as  well as in vitro models that aim to optimize growth and flesh quality. First,  the possibility to increase growth in terms of biological limitation has been  studied with GH prolonged treatments. The search for adequate components  or potential additives to the diet that can determine a better GH/IGF axis status  will be summarized. Finally, the physical activity of the fish during the culture  can increase growth and model the muscle structure improving flesh texture.  The regulatory mechanisms for such processes have been investigated in  different species and will be also presented. All these approaches combined  with other technical improvements can result in a significant increase of fish  production and quality, necessary to satisfy the society demand for healthy  aquatic products.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of marine aquaculture solid waste as a nutrient source for the nursery production of two salt tolerant plants commonly used in coastal salt marsh restoration, Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) and Juncus roemerianus (black needlerush). Specifically, measurements of plant biomass and tissue nitrogen and phosphorus allocation were compared between plants fertilized with dried shrimp biofloc solids and unfertilized controls, as well as between plants fertilized with dried fish solids and unfertilized controls. In both experiments, S. alterniflora plants fertilized with marine aquaculture solids showed few significant differences from unfertilized controls, whereas fertilized J. roemerianus plants had significantly greater biomass and absorbed and incorporated more nutrients in plant tissue compared to unfertilized controls. These results suggest that J. roemerianus may be a suitable plant species for the remediation of marine aquaculture solid waste.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an integrated food production technology of aquaculture and hydroponics. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is an economically important vegetable crop that can be grown aquaponically. In addition to selecting the right choice of lettuce cultivars, developing an optimal harvest strategy could increase lettuce production. Lettuce production using two harvest methods, Cut-and-Come-Again (CC) and Once-and-Done (OD), was evaluated using ‘Red Sails’ lettuce in a flow-through aquaponic system rearing trout. With the CC method continual harvesting was possible on a weekly basis after the initial harvest, while it took five weeks for each harvest using the OD method. The total yield of lettuce by the CC method was 6.7 kg from 9 trays, while 22.6 kg of lettuce was harvested by the OD method using 54 trays. In harvests by the OD method, 6 times as many seeds were sown compared to the CC method. The average yield per tray harvested by the CC method (744.4 g/tray) was 78\% higher than that by the OD method (418.5 g/tray) because the CC method used 6 times less trays. Productivity, calculated by the average yield per growing week, of the two harvest methods at the first harvest was similar, but 4.8 times higher in the CC method than in the OD method at the second harvest due to the shorter harvest time. However, visual and decay ratings of lettuce harvested by the CC method began to decline afterwards. Together, the OD method after two consecutive harvests by the CC method would help growers to obtain increased yield of quality lettuce.},

  abstract = {Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is an important vegetable crop that can be grown in hydroponic and aquaponic systems. A comparative study to evaluate the efficacy of a cold water flowthrough aquaponic system (FTS) to a hydroponic system is lacking. Twenty-seven lettuce cultivars with green or red leaves, in seven subtypes, belonging to four popular types in the Western diet, were grown in spring water or aquaponic or hydroponic treatments. Spring and aquaponic water flowed directly from a spring and a raceway growing rainbow trout, respectively. The hydroponic treatment had nutrients added to a recirculated system. Stand establishment, average yield, and productivity (yield/week) were determined for each subtype or cultivar and compared among water treatments. No comparison among lettuce types, subtypes, or cultivars was made due to inherent differences among genotypes. Total yield and productivity (402.5 g·m−2 and 4.9 kg/tray/week, respectively) in the FTS were lower than those in the hydroponic system (468.9 g·m−2 and 6.7 kg/tray/week, respectively). Average yields of butterhead and bibb subtypes in aquaponics were higher than in the hydroponic treatment. Bibb subtype lettuces performed better in the aquaponic treatment, and average yields of butterhead and romaine, one of the most popular and nutritious lettuce types, were similar to those in the hydroponic treatment. The cvs. Outredgeous in romaine, Winter Density in bibb, Red Sails in leaf, and Red Saladbowl in oakleaf subtypes were recommended for an FTS. Average yields of green lettuces were higher than red lettuces in the bibb subtype in all treatments. Lettuce yield, depending on cultivar, could be comparable to hydroponic or field production based upon yield per area.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the combination of hydroponics and aquaculture that sustainably produces both animal and plant food products. Soluble nutrients are released into water by the fish providing nutrition for plant growth. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is one of the most popular vegetables grown in aquaponic systems. In this experiment, the feasibility of year-round lettuce production utilizing a cold water flow-through aquaponic system (FTS) growing trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in a high tunnel was evaluated. A high tunnel is a greenhouse-like facility constructed with polyethylene covering a metal frame which extends the growing season and protects the crop from cold temperatures. The average night air temperature inside the high tunnel during winter in Wardensville, WV was 2.9±3.4 °C and it helped extend the growing period into the fall and winter. Results from this pilot scale experiment showed the potential for year-round lettuce production in an FTS. Average yield (fresh harvest weight per tray) in the spring season was the highest, while productivity (average yield per week) during the summer season was higher than that in spring. During the extended growing seasons (fall and winter), more than a quarter (30.6\%) of the total lettuce production was obtained. The yield per unit area (7.4 kg m-2) from our pilot study was significantly higher than that from the reported average field production (3.1 kg m-2) in the U.S. except California and Arizona where year-round production of lettuce occurs. To compensate for lower lettuce yields during cold seasons, high value crops requiring less nutrients and tolerant to the colder environment may be considered.},

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of four growing substrates on the yield of lettuce grown in aquaponic system. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four treatments, which corresponded to the substrates, and six replicates. Plants were grown using the nutrient film technique (NFT) system. The substrates used in the experiment were: coconut shell fiber with crushed stone \#3, expanded vermiculite, zeolite and phenolic foam. The treatment with phenolic foam was considered as the least suitable for lettuce cultivation in aquaponic system, because it caused lower yield (20.8 t ha-1). The treatment using coconut shell fiber with crushed stone \#3 was considered as the most adequate, since it led to higher yield (39.9 t ha-1) compared with the other substrates analyzed.},

The parameters analyzed were: crop yield and percentage of roots per plant. In addition, macronutrient contents were analyzed in the leaves. The substrate composed of coconut shell fiber was more suitable for lettuce production, since it led to higher yields for both aquaponic (2.88 kg m-2) and hydroponic (2.58 kg m-2) systems.

In the 1950s, recirculating aquaculture also emerged in response to similar water limitations in arid regions in order to make better use of available water resources and better contain wastes. However, disposal of sludge from such systems remained problematic, thus leading to the advent of aquaponics, wherein the recycling of nutrients produced by fish as fertilizer for plants proved to be an innovative solution to waste discharge that also had economic advantages by producing a second marketable product. Aquaponics was also shown to be an adaptable and cost-effective technology given that farms could be situated in areas that are otherwise unsuitable for agriculture, for instance, on rooftops and on unused, derelict factory sites. A wide range of cost savings could be achieved through strategic placement of aquaponics sites to reduce land acquisition costs, and by also allowing farming closer to suburban and urban areas, thus reducing transportation costs to markets and hence also the fossil fuel and CO2 footprints of production.},

The overall productivity depends on technical specifications for water quality and its movement amongst components of the system, including a wide range of parameters including factors such as pH and flow rates which ensure that microbial components can act effectively in nitrification and remineralization processes. In this chapter, we explore current research examining the role of microbial communities in three units of an aquaponics system: (1) the recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) for fish production which includes biofiltration systems for denitrification; (2) the hydroponics units for plant production; and (3) biofilters and bioreactors, including sludge digester systems (SDS) involved in microbial decomposition and recovery/ remineralization of solid wastes. In the various sub-disciplines related to each of these components, there is existing literature about microbial communities and their importance within each system (e.g. recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), hydroponics, biofilters and digesters), but there is currently limited work examining interactions between these components in aquaponics system, thus making it an important area for further research.},

  abstract = {The human population has been growing at least at the rate of 1.2\% annually since 1960 reaching up to 6.4B in 2002 and more than 7.0B in 2012. In Davao City, the annual population growth rate is running at 3.22\% in year 1990, at 2.41\% last 2007 and recently in 2013 at 2.36\%. The alarming problem we confront today is that the increase in land area for human use does not expand in proportion to population density increase. It is the aim of this study to address the future problems on land and food shortage through the efficient integration of vertical farms on mixed-use multi-storied commercial-residential buildings in Davao City in order to provide income generating condominiums and produce organic crops for residents in an urban setting. The result of the computations showed that the integration of farms to mixed-use residential-commercial buildings in Davao City is highly feasible. The gross profit is highest using gross floor area percentage ratio combination of 50:5:20 for residential, commercial and vertical farm units respectively. (i.e., 50\% of the building’s gross floor area should be allotted to residential units, 5\% to commercial units, and 20\% to farm units). Moreover the gross profit and ROI of the 50:5:20 gross floor area ratio also generated the highest which amounted to Php 1,785,316,198.00B compared to only Php 501,045,100.00M for the typical commercial-residential buildings in five years. This research has mainly focused on the integration of hydroponics, but the inclusion of aquaponic farms in vertical structures can also be further explored.},

System thinking is seen as a central skill in education for sustainability. Between October 2007 and January 2008, a teaching sequence took place with three classes of 7th grade students in the Zuerich agglomeration, Switzerland. Several themes were introduced in the lessons by means of a classroom model: what is a system, relationship between system components, feedback loops and self-regulation and finally planning and construction of an Aquaponic classroom system. The students then also operated and monitored the system. The effect of the teaching sequence on system thinking competences was assessed at the beginning and at the end of the sequence. The ability of students to think in a systemic way instead of linear succession improved significantly in the posttest compared to the pretest. In addition, gender specific differences in relation to learning systemic thinking were compared. Female students showed slightly better results than male students; the reasons for this could not be pinpointed.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of possible strategies for implementing aquaponics in curricula at different levels of education, illustrated by case studies from different countries. Aquaponics can promote scientific literacy and provide a useful tool for teaching the natural sciences at all levels, from primary through to tertiary education. An aquaponics classroom model system can provide multiple ways of enriching classes in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and the day-to-day maintenance of an aquaponics can also enable experiential learning. Aquaponics can thus become an enjoyable and effective way for learners to study STEM content, and can also be used for teaching subjects such as business and economics, and for addressing issues like sustainable development, environmental science, agriculture, food systems, and health. Using learner and teacher evaluations of the use of aquaponics at different educational levels, we attempt to answer the question of whether aquaponics fulfils its promise as an educational tool.},

  abstract = {Global environmental, social and economic challenges drive the need for new and improved solutions for food production and consumption. Food production within a sustainability corridor requires innovations exceeding traditional paradigms, acknowledging the complexity arising from sustainability. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how to direct further activities, to develop technologies as potential solutions for questions related to climate change, loss of soil fertility and biodiversity, scarcity of resources, and shortage of drinking water. One approach that promises to address these problems is controlled environment agriculture. Aquaponics (AP) combines two technologies: recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) and hydroponics (plant production in water, without soil) in a closed-loop system. One challenge to the development of this technology is the conversion of the toxic ammonium produced by the fish into nitrate, via bacteria in a biofilter, to provide nitrogen to the plants. However, as this Special Issue shows, there are many other challenges that need to be addressed if the goal of the technology is to contribute to more sustainable food production systems.},

Additions of biodegradable organic acid solubilized heavy metals better than HCl, while additions of 1.5\% w/v glucose followed by 7 day incubation stabilized the sludge releasing 92\% P, 100\% Fe. The use of homo-lactic Lactobacillus plantarum starter cultures were more effective than hetero-lactic Lactobacillus buchneri, solubilizing 81.9\% P, 92.2\% Fe, 93.0\% Zn and 96.4\% Ca in the sludge. The anaerobic sludge-glucose fermentation using L. plantarum produced a leached sludge that has low heavy metal and nutrient content while affording the recovery of nutrients.

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an intensive sustainable food production system that combines aquaculture and hydroponics, in which fish and plants grow together symbiotically. In an aquaponic unit, the effluent rich nutrients derived from nitrogenous waste excreted from fish, fish feed and decomposing organic matter, fertilizes hydroponic beds providing essential nutrients for plant growth. Simplified raft aquaponic system vary greatly in design and construction, but perform all key functions of plant and fish production, removal of suspended solids and bacterial nitrification. All life forms require nitrogen as an integral part of proteins and nucleic acids, therefore all living organisms are involved in the nitrogen cycle. This process is primarily accomplished by two groups of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria that can build organic molecules and utilize CO2 as the carbon source for biosynthesis and oxidation of nitrogen compounds as the energy source. A broad range of major parameters and factors affecting bacterial growth has been studied in this paper which are essential for nitrification, that include healthy biofilter with appropriate water conditions like, water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen concentrations. Characterization and identification of bacterial populations in an aquaponics system has been carried out by cultivation-dependant techniques and traditional methods of analyzing microbial communities using standard light microscopy.},

In defiance of its noteworthiness, there is a large e xception in acco mplishing it as livelihood due to its investment inadequacy. Agriculture currently visage plenty of hindrance including insubstantial machineries deployed in farm, insufficiency in integrity of machineries, unconventional cyclones, inadequate manures, deficit of labour force, indecorous yield. Nurturing nutrients to the farm becomes crucial in agriculture. Smart farming benefits out fro m sensors like temperature sensors, mo isture sensors, and macroclimate prediction hinged on investigating system, inaccessible areas accessed over satellite co mmunicat ion, RFID exp loration system, drones inclusive of sensors and camcorder fo r profitable farming. Using the aforementioned technologies, the farming can be transformed onto a co mpetent endurable farming. The tolerance in agricu lture is solely measured by the requirement of consistent provision of conventional amen ities including nutrimental manures, water, hu midity, daylight, and nitrified soil. To attain superior farming benefits, the farm’s requirements need to be monitored and provided with the sufficient inputs instantly. In dissection beyond ancestral farming techniques, the proposed system of aquaponics model is the legitimate scheme in harvesting the needy floras. This system draws down minimu m quantity of water estimated to be less than 15 percent. In inclusion of the system for our cu ltivation process, it gives us a provision on furnishing affordable grow bed system with natural co mpositions like alluvial soil bead, live coal, and gravel coat. The planting environment is centered on nutrition preservation fraction in the grow bed in reference to the tier of vegetables raised. In order to do so, a well flourishing nutrition rich fertigation system is required. The system proposes fertigation assisted with grow -bed for the cultivation of to mato. The fert igation process is taken care by the fish tank. Here, ornamental fishes are included for the experiment and the pH value is measured periodically for maintaining a good fert igation system. The system is provided with u ltrasonic sensor and moisture sensor to predict the growth of plants. The excess water provided is drawn down to fish tank to culminate fishes. The water in fish tank is taken back to irrigate plants after p redict ing the PH values of water fro m fish tank. The gadget is IoT empowered and the systemensures a justifiable proficiency.},

  abstract = {Saline soil and saline groundwater reduce agricultural productivity on drylands. We are developing a new aquaponics system to improve food productivity on such lands while effectively utilizing saline groundwater. In this study, cultivation of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L. spp. cicla cv. Seiyou Shirokuki) was carried out using fish wastewater with a high salt concentration (1150 mg L−1 NaCl). The levels of microelements (e.g., Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) in the fish wastewater were very low, so we added microelements at 100\% (W100), 50\% (W50), 25\% (W25), and 0\% (W0) of the levels in the standard hydroponics solution to the fish wastewater and investigated the effects on growth of Swiss chard. At the first harvest, yields in all wastewater treatments were as high or higher than in the control. At the second harvest, yields in W100, W50, and W25 were not significantly different from the control, while in W0 the yield was significantly lower and chlorosis was evident. At the third harvest, the yield in all wastewater treatments was less than in the control, and chlorosis symptoms were observed in W25 and W0. Since leaf Mn and Zn concentrations in W25 and W0 had decreased to below the critical values for those microelements, Mn and Zn deficiency might have contributed to the observed chlorosis and yield loss. For the cultivation of Swiss chard with fish wastewater, sufficient yield (i.e., comparable to or better than the control) without chlorosis was obtained when microelements were added at 50\% of the level of the control solution. In addition, since sufficient yield was obtained even in W0 at the first harvest, it is suggested that longer-term cultivation and higher yield could be achieved by applying 50\% microelements after the first harvest.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture has been the fastest growing sector in food production for multiple decades and is expected to resume this trend for the foreseeable future. However, its continuous growth led to increasing issues concerning wastewater treatment, energy management and environmental friendliness. To improve wastewater treatment in established aquaculture flow-through systems, a preliminary trial was conducted testing the potential effects of a biofilter with an integrated vermiculture and a hydroponic unit on the ammonium, nitrite and nitrate concentration in the effluent water from a traditional trout farm. This cost-effective filter system was able to reduce ammonium-waste in the effluent. Observations suggest that the biofilter was the main factor behind this reduction. Although the nature of this preliminary study could not conclusively clarify all factors involved in this wastewater treatment method, it could demonstrate the great potential of this cost-effective system in classical aquaculture facilities. This short communication will discuss the potential benefit of innovative adaption of integrated aquaculture in established fish farms, its limitations and further research needs.},

  abstract = {Agricultural production systems are known to be large contributors to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and many studies have focused on the mitigation of GHG emissions from open-field and other traditional crop production practices. Little attention has been given to direct emissions from non-traditional production systems such as aquaponics. Here we determine direct GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) from a pilot-scale biofloc, decoupled aquaponics facility. We also determine how emissions from unit operations differ based on a set of environmental and operational parameters e.g. temperature, feeding rate, suspended solids, plant height, water flow rate, and nitrate levels. Major unit operations included a biofloc fish tank stocked with tilapia, a solids settling clarification system, and a climate-controlled greenhouse in which cucumber plants were grown in substrate culture. The study was separated into three seasons. In the summer of 2019, different pH treatments for cucumber irrigation water were tested. In the fall of 2019 and winter of 2020, emissions from perlite versus pine bark substrates were tested during cucumber production. Measurements indicated that aerial GHG emissions in intensively aerated areas of the fish tank were 4.7 to 46.8 times higher than those in areas with low-intensity aeration. High methane emissions (up to 44.8 g m-2 d-1) from the clarification system indicated anaerobic activity. Results from plant production showed a negative relationship between pH and N2O efflux (p=0.0001) while the choice of plant growth substrate had no significant effect on direct GHG emissions. Overall, carbon sequestration in plants could offset 40\% to 62\% of direct GHG emissions from the aquaponics system. This study provides insight into operational parameters that affect direct GHG emissions from aquaponics systems and provides data to support life cycle assessments.},

Since the heat stress and heavy rain can affect the plant growth, thus this project is equipped with the sensors to control the excessive amount of water and heat to the plant. There are three main sensors used in this project, which are soil moisture, rain and heat sensors. The soil moisture sensor circuit diagram controls the watering system for the plant. If the soil gets dry, the fish tank water will be supplied to the plant by using motor/water pump. The rain and heat sensor circuits help to detect excessive water and heat stress to the plant. These circuits will trigger the roof/shelter to shade the plant.},

In this study performance of four different types of water treatment technique was investigated in cocopeat media filled grow bed aquaponics system. The techniques that had been investigated were mechanical filter, biological filter, combination of both mechanical and biological filters and grow media (cocopeat) itself as filtration media. The effectiveness these techniques were assessed through (i) water quality and nutrients level of circulated water and (ii) growth rates of plant (Gynura procumbens) and Red Nile Tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) The (i) water quality (pH, temperature, total suspended solid and dissolved oxygen) (ii) nutrient level (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate) and (iii) grow rates of plant and fish were weekly measured for this study. The results revealed that cocopeat media filled grow bed only was insufficient to act as water treatment unit in the aquaponics system studied. The aquaponics system required at least a biological or mechanical filter to produce acceptable yields of fish and plant. For the long term, the combination of axial flow and biofilter with superlative ratio was suggested in order to produce the best performance of parameters studied. This integrated technique was able to maintain the water quality within the tolerance limit of fish besides supplying enough amount nutrients (especially nitrate) for the plant growth and easier maintenance work in terms of cleaning and disposal of sludge.},

An integrated fish and hydroponics bell pepper system was evaluated for application in Central Laboratory for Aquaculture Research at Abassa, Sharkia Governorate, The system was constructed from readily available materials, and designed to minimize capital costs, energy, water use, and the technological skills needed for operation. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloiicus) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L. 'Godeon') were cultured for 180 days in a closed system containing 1160 L of water for each unit. Six units were used with three treatments (all three treatments were in duplicated) to determine the effect of the integration between plant number /m 2 to fish density (100 fish /m 3) on fish performance. Each unit consists of 500 L fish rearing tank, hydroponic tank (2 m 2), filter and sump. Treatments were Ti (fish culture with 10 plant/m 2), T 2 (fish culture with 15 plant/m 2) and T3 fish culture without plant (control). Water quality suitable for fish production was maintained by aeration, mechanical and biological filtration, hydroponics vegetable production unit and the addition of make-up water. Fish metabolites, and wasted feed served as nutrient sources for pepper production. The results showed that Ti (fish culture with 10 plants /m 2) gave the best significant (P\textbackslash textless0.05) fish production 20.1 kg / m , followed by T 2 (fish culture with 15 plants /m 2) 17.95 kg / m and the lowest (P\textbackslash textless0.05) was T 3 fish culture without plant (control) 16.3 kg / m 3. Also Ti (fish culture with 10 plants /m 2) was higher in average yield of marketable bell pepper 11.34 kgfai 2 (P\textbackslash textgreater0.05) than T 2 (fish culture with 15 plants /m 2) 86 S ALAH M. KAMAL which produced 9.43 kg/m 2. Under the condition of the present study, results show in general that units integrated with hydroponic pepper T] and T2 resulted in best economic efficiency, and Ti was better than T2.},

  abstract = {This work presents a review of life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies of hydrogen electrolysis using power from photovoltaic (PV) systems. The paper discusses the assumptions, strengths and weaknesses of 13 LCA studies and identifies the causes of the environmental impact. Differences in assumptions of system boundaries, system sizes, evaluation methods, and functional units make it challenging to directly compare the Global Warming Potential (GWP) resulting from different studies. To simplify this process, 13 selected LCA studies on PV-powered hydrogen production have been harmonized following a consistent framework described by this paper. The harmonized GWP values vary from 0.7 to 6.6 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 which can be considered a wide range. The maximum absolute difference between the original and harmonized GWP results of a study is 1.5 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. Yet even the highest GWP of this study is over four times lower than the GWP of grid-powered electrolysis in Germany. Due to the lack of transparency of most LCAs included in this review, full identification of the sources of discrepancies (methods applied, assumed production conditions) is not possible. Overall it can be concluded that the environmental impact of the electrolytic hydrogen production process is mainly caused by the GWP of the electricity supply. For future environmental impact studies on hydrogen production systems, it is highly recommended to 1) divide the whole system into well-defined subsystems using compression as the final stage of the LCA and 2) to provide energy inputs/GWP results for the different subsystems.},

  abstract = {In this article, optimal control methods based on a metaboliteconstrained fish growth model are applied to the operation of fish production in an aquaponic system. The system is formulated for the twin objective of fish growth and plant fertilization to maximize the benefits by optimal and efficient use of resources from aquaculture. The state equations, basically mass balances, required by the optimization algorithms are given in the form of differential equations for the number of fish in the stock, their average weight as mediated through metabolism and appetite, the water recirculation and waste treatment, hydroponic nutrient requirements and their loss functions. Six parameters, that is, water temperature, flow rate, stock density, feed ration size per fish, energy consumption rate and the quality of food (percentage of digestible proteins) are used to control the system under dynamic conditions. The time to harvest is treated as a static decision variable that is repeatedly adjusted to find the profit-maximizing solution. By modeling the complex interactions between the economic and biological systems, it is possible to obtain the most efficient decisions with respect to diet composition, feeding rates, harvesting time and nutrient releases. Some sample numerical results using data from a tilapia-tomato farm are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics are feedback and two player systems, in which fish and crops mutually benefit from one another and, therefore require close monitoring, management and control. Vast amount of data and information flow from the aquaponics plant itself with its huge amount of smart sensors for water quality, fish and plant growth, system state etc. and from the stakeholder, e.g., farmers, retailers and end consumers. The intelligent management of aquaponics is only possible if this data and information are managed and used in an intelligent way. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to introduce an intelligent information management (IIM) for aquaponics. It will be shown how the information can be used to create services such as predictive analytics, system optimization and anomaly detection to improve the aquaponics system. The results show that the system enabled full traceability and transparency in the aquaponics processes (customers can follow what is going on at the farm), reduced water and energy use and increased revenue through early fault detection. In this, paper the information management approach will be introduced and the key benefits of the digitized aquaponics system will be given.},

Aquaponics is a highly efficient way of farming and is becoming increasingly popular. However, large scale aquaponics still lack stability, standardization and proof of economical profitability. The EU-INAPRO project helps to overcome these limitations by introducing digitization, enhanced technology, and developing standardized modular scalable solutions and demonstrating the viability of large aquaponics. INAPRO is based on an innovation a double water recirculation system (DRAPS), one for fish, and the other one for crops. In DRAPS, optimum conditions can be set up individually for fish and crops to increase productivity of both. Moreover, the integration of digital technologies and data management in the aquaculture production and processing systems will enable full traceability and transparency in the processes, increasing consumers’ trust in aquaculture products. In this paper, the innovations and the digitization approach will be introduced and explained and the key benefits of the system will be emphasized.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic systems require energy in different forms, heat, solar radiation, electricity etc. Typical actuator components of an aquaponic system include pumps, aerators, heaters, coolers, feeders, propagators, lights, etc., which need electrical energy to operate. Hybrid Energy Systems (HES) can help in improving the economic and environmental sustainability of aquaponic systems with respect to energy aspects. Energy management is one of the key issues in operating the HES, which needs to be optimized with respect to the current and future change in generation, demand, and market price, etc. In this paper, a Decision Support System (DSS) for optimal energy management of an aquaponic system that integrates different energy sources and storage mechanisms according to priorities will be presented. The integrated model consists of photovoltaic and solar thermal modules, wind turbine, hydropower, biomass plant, CHP, gas boiler, energy and heat storage systems and access to the power grid and district heating. The results show that the proposed method can significantly increase the utilization of HES and reduce the exchange with the power grid and district heating and consequently reduce running costs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Aquaponics is a technology that has minimal impact on the environment and which is often promoted as a solution for sustainable food production. Developing aquaponics sustainably requires a thorough understanding of the biological components of the system. Recent reports on the bacterial populations of aquaponics systems using new DNA sequencing technologies are revealing a complex and diverse microbial ecosystem. The purpose of this review is to present information on microbial composition and various factors affecting bacterial activity in aquaponics systems. Approaches for establishing a bacterial ecosystem during the setup of an aquaponics system, and microbiological safety of aquaponics products are also highlighted. Methods: This review was developed by evaluating and synthesising current literature of peer-reviewed publications related to aquaponics and microbial communities. Based on the results from credible academic journals, publications were categorised into five groups: methods used to characterise microbiomes, biofiltration microorganisms, bacterial diversity, biofilter establishment, and safety of aquaponics products. Results: The microbial ecosystem is essential for biological filtration of water through the mineralisation of nutrients required for plant growth in an integrated system. The aquaponics microbiome is complex, and bacterial composition varies between the different compartments of these systems. Establishing these bacterial ecosystems is essential for optimal functioning of aquaponics. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes are dominant in aquaponics systems. Despite bacteria being fundamental to aquaponics, there are currently no reports of human pathogens in aquaponics products. Conclusion: Knowledge of the composition of bacterial populations in aquaponics systems will enhance understanding of relationships and functions within the microbiome. This in turn will allow for the establishment of sustainable and healthy aquaponics systems for food production.},

  abstract = {Fresh vegetables harbour diverse bacterial populations on their surfaces which are important for plant health and growth. Information on epiphytic bacteria is limited to only a few types of vegetables and it is unknown how the lettuce epiphytic bacterial community structure may respond when a probiotic product is added to an aquaponic system. In this study, we evaluated lettuce growth and analysed epiphytic bacterial communities of lettuce based on metabarcoding analysis of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene obtained from paired-end Illumina MiSeq reads. The addition of Bacillus probiotics resulted in a significant increase of nitrate and phosphate in the deep-water culture solution, as well as increased vegetative growth of lettuce. Metabarcoding analysis revealed that the most abundant phyla on lettuce leaf surfaces were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. The in-depth bacterial composition analysis indicated that genera Chryseobacterium, Bacillus, Pantoea, Pseudoduganella, Flavobacterium, Paludibacter, and Cloacibacterium were dominant in leaf samples obtained from Bacillus-treated systems. Analysis of lettuce epiphytic bacterial communities of the fresh lettuce leaf surfaces also indicated the presence of food-borne pathogens belonging to the Shigella and Aeromonas genera, which were less abundant in the probiotic treated systems. This study provides the first characterization of the epiphytic bacterial community structure and how it can be modulated by the addition of a probiotic mixture to the nutrient solution of aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {The integration of probiotics in aquaponics systems is a strategy for mitigating environmental impacts and for promoting sustainable agriculture. In order to understand the role of probiotics, we investigated the effect of a commercial probiotic mixture of Bacillus subtilis and B. licheniformis on the growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) under deep-water culture integrated with Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). We determined plant growth, water quality parameters, and leaf mineral analysis, and assessed the influence of a probiotic mixture on the microbiota. Bacterial communities were analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Compared to the control systems, the addition of the probiotic Bacillus significantly increased the concentration of nitrate and phosphate in deep water culture solution, which contributed to improved lettuce growth. In both the growth trials, the Fv/Fm, the mean shoot dry weight, and the mean fresh weight of the harvested shoots from the Bacillus treatment were significantly higher than those observed for the control plants. Higher concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, and zinc in the lettuce leaves were found in systems that received the Bacillus. Although differences were observed at the phylum level, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were predominant in both the Bacillus-treatment and the control systems. At the genus level, however, the communities present in the two types of systems were heterogeneous with Bacillus-treated systems, containing significantly higher numbers of Chryseobacterium, Bacillus, Nitrospira, Polynucleobacter, and Thermomonas. The results indicate that Bacillus supplementation can effectively alleviate nutrient deficiencies, improve water quality, and modify the composition of bacterial communities in aquaponics systems.},

  abstract = {Iron is one of the essential micronutrients for plant development and fish growth in aquaponic systems. Iron is an essential element for photosynthesis, DNA synthesis, and many other cellular functions for plants. With regard to fish, it is an integral component of proteins involved in cellular respiration and oxygen transfer. Aquaponic systems are often iron deficient due to low amounts of iron in commercial fish feeds. Therefore, iron needs to be supplemented to ensure optimal plant performance. Adding these supplements requires close management of the system, and careful selection of chelating substances as the Fe-chelate bioavailability is environment dependent. Reports of iron supplementation and management in aquaponic systems are limited. This review critically examines iron supplementation strategies, different sources of iron and factors influencing iron uptake for optimal biomass production. The effectiveness of different iron chelates is also discussed. Furthermore, optimum ranges of dissolved iron concentrations for different components in an aquaponic system are reported. This review aims to provide a better understanding of iron optimisation strategies to minimise iron deficiency and enhance biomass growth.},

The genera Massilia, Mucilaginibacter, Mizugakiibacter, and Rhodoluna were most dominant in the dry, root, and mineralized zones and in the effluent water, respectively. The number of shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for the three zones was 241, representing 7.15\% of the total observed OTUs. The number of unique OTUs in samples from dry zone, root zone, mineralized zone, and effluent water was 485, 638, 445, and 383, respectively. The samples from the root zone harbored more diverse communities than either the dry or mineralized zones. This study is the first to report on the bacterial community within the zones of a flood-and-drain media bed. Thus, this information will potentially accelerate studies on other microbial communities involved in the bioconversion of nitrogen compounds and mineralization within these types of aquaponic systems.},

Food plants feed on bacteria - the waste products of fish, while the water returns to the pond in purified form. Comparison of drying at room temperature and at 105 °C (an indicator of thermal stability) showed increase the total antioxidant activity by 5.25\% for the Mahagon salad and 7.18\% for the Lollo Bionda salad compared to the calculated values found with taking into account the humidity of the samples. The phenomenon of synergism was fixes for samples dried at room temperature with increasing the total antioxidant activity of the Mahogany salad by 21.07\% and 13.62\% for the Lollo Bionda salad because of the oxidation of water extracts of salad samples by 3\% medical hydrogen peroxide. For samples dried at 105 °C synergism phenomenon were fixed with increasing the activity of the Mahogany salad by 2.97\%, while the activity value of the Lollo Bionda salad were not changed. More active growth was observed in salads planted in plastic containers with pebbles than on a mesh cloth, while the length of their leaves increased from 12 mm to 130 mm, the root system became more branched by the end of the experiment, the color of the leaves was bright green.},

  abstract = {Sustainably feeding the next generation is often described as one of the most pressing “grand challenges” facing the 21st century. Generally, scholars propose addressing this problem by increasing agricultural production, investing in technology to boost yields, changing diets, or reducing food waste. In this paper, we explore whether global food production is nutritionally balanced by comparing the diet that nutritionists recommend versus global agricultural production statistics. Results show that the global agricultural system currently overproduces grains, fats, and sugars while production of fruits and vegetables and protein is not sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of the current population. Correcting this imbalance could reduce the amount of arable land used by agriculture by 51 million ha globally but would increase total land used for agriculture by 407 million ha and increase greenhouse gas emissions. For a growing population, our calculations suggest that the only way to eat a nutritionally balanced diet, save land and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to consume and produce more fruits and vegetables as well as transition to diets higher in plant-based protein. Such a move will help protect habitats and help meet the Sustainable Development Goals.},

A systematic way to postulate, calibrate and validate, as provided by systems theory, can therefore be very helpful. In this chapter, dynamic systems modelling of aquaponic (AP) systems, from a systems theoretical perspective, is considered and demonstrated to each of the subsystems of the AP system, such as fish tanks, anaerobic digester and hydroponic (HP) greenhouse. It further shows the links between the subsystems, so that in principle a complete AP systems model can be built and integrated into daily practice with respect to management and control of AP systems. The main challenge is to choose an appropriate model complexity that meets the experimental data for estimation of parameters and states and allows us to answer questions related to the modelling objective, such as simulation, experiment design, prediction and control.},

This indeed has not been obtainable in Nigeria as there is still a good number of people who don’t have access to healthy foods. To ensure the eradication of hunger and malnutrition in Nigeria, there has to be an intentional and deliberate attempt to treat the root causes of food scarcity, under/over utilization, instability and unavailability of food. The root causes which include: lack of access to technologies that improve productions, climate change, poor soil management practices, insurgencies, transportation difficulties, poverty, ban on foreign importation, poor pest control techniques, inadequate water supply, disease outbreaks, food wastage and lack of adequate preservation facilities. To solve the problem of food insecurity in Nigeria, innovations to sustainable food security such as aeroponics, aquaponics, hydroponics, tissue culture, selective breeding, genetic engineering, direct seeding and biofortification must be recognized and implemented. Furthermore, food processing and preservation technologies which are high pressure processing, high pressure thermal processing, pulsed electric field processing, cool plasma and ultraviolet light processing should be practiced and also insurgencies and poverty issues should be well addressed.},

  abstract = {Growing urbanization in Kathmandu Valley has reduced the agriculture land and is anticipated further reduction coming days leading to agricultural vulnerability. The increasing built-up areas, however, might be opportunity for alternative methods of agriculture production like aquaponics which incorporates both aquaculture and hydroponics in a single unit. This system helps to produce food (fish and vegetables), especially in the areas where the availability of cultivable land and water is scarce. This study was carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of aquaponics in Kathmandu Valley. For the experiment, two media filled aquaponic systems (MFS) covering one square meter area were set-up using hogplum (Choerospondias axillaries) seeds (Bh) and gravels (Bg) as growing media in hydroponic and systems were named as AS-1 and AS-2, respectively. In both Bh and Bg, 11 seedlings of Indian spinach having 5 g total weight were transplanted in grow bed containing hog-plum, and 15 catfish (Clariasbatrachus) having 45 g weight were stocked in Tank-1 (T-1) of AS-1. Likewise, in AS-2 system, 5 g spinach were transplanted in grow-bed containing gravel, and 34 carp (Cyprinus sp.) fish having 34 g weight were stocked in Tank-2 (T-2) of AS-2. After 40 days, 550 g spinach was produced from the system containing hog-plum seeds as growbed and 1060 g spinach from the system containing gravel as grow-bed. Likewise, 45 g catfish reached 550 g in 90 days in Tank-1 (T-1) and 34 g carp reached 109 g in Tank-2 (T2). All the growth performances like specific growth rate (SGR), average daily growth (ADG), daily growth index (DGI), percent weight gain (\%WG) of Indian spinach in grow-bed containing gravel (Bg) were found higher in comparison to the grow-bed containing hog-plum seed (Bh). The survival rate of catfish and carp was found to be 86.7\% and 90.6\%, respectively. The growth performance of Indian spinach was significantly different (p{$<$}0.05) in the two growing media.},

These organic wastes require to be managed in a sustainable way to avoid depletion of natural resources, minimize risk to human health, reduce environmental burdens and maintain an overall balance in the ecosystem. A number of methods are currently applied to the treatment and management of solid organic waste. This review focuses on the process of anaerobic digestion which is considered to be one of the most viable options for recycling the organic fraction of solid waste. This manuscript provides a broad overview of the digestibility and energy production (biogas) yield of a range of substrates and the digester configurations that achieve these yields. The involvement of a diverse array of microorganisms and effects of co-substrates and environmental factors on the efficiency of the process has been comprehensively addressed. The recent literature indicates that anaerobic digestion could be an appealing option for converting raw solid organic wastes into useful products such as biogas and other energy-rich compounds, which may play a critical role in meeting the world’s ever-increasing energy requirements in the future.},

Recirculated aquaculture systems (RAS) form a major part of aquaponic systems but knowledge about their potential to benefit plant growth and suppress their pathogens is limited. The current study tested if the diversity and function of microbial communities in two commercial RAS were specific to the fish species used (Tilapia or Clarias) and sampling site (fish tanks and wastewaters), and whether they confer benefits to plants and have in vitro antagonistic potential towards plant pathogens. Microbial diversity and composition was found to be dependent on fish species and sample site. The Tilapia RAS hosted higher bacterial diversity than the Clarias RAS; but the latter hosted higher fungal diversity. Both Tilapia and Clarias RAS hosted bacterial and fungal communities that promoted plant growth, inhibited plant pathogens and encouraged biodegradation. The production of extracellular enzymes, related to nutrient availability and pathogen control, by bacterial strains isolated from the Tilapia and Clarias systems, makes them a promising tool in aquaponics and in their system design.},

Development towards bioeconomical based cultivation system using industrial symbioses makes application of aquaponics systems in areas with surpluses or excess heat of great interest. Within the frame of these surpluses a significant amount of energy leaves the processes as low-grade heat through flue gas stacks and cooling water. However, little knowledge is available about the effect of low water temperature on the growth and microbial parameters in an aquaponics system. Investigations in the current study were thus carried out to study the effect of water temperature of 11°C compared with 21°C on plant growth, nutrient and microbial dynamic in aquaponic systems. Two cultivation systems (treatments) were used, an aquaponic system consisted of a fish tank, a biofilter and a plant unit, and a hydroponic system (control) consisted of a water tank and a plant unit. Basil and trout were used as model organisms. The experiment was run for a period of eight weeks and repeated over time. The results indicated good fish growth and better plant growth in aquaponics systems compared with hydroponic systems at both water temperatures. The growth, as indicated by plant biomass, leaf length and width as well as nitrate content in the leaves, was better at water temperature of 21°C compared with 11°C. Low water temperature of 11°C indicated a negative effect on biofiltration, microbial dynamics and disease incidence in the system. Negative correlation between the total nitrogen removal rate and low water temperature was also indicated.},

Aquaponics uses the water from the fish to feed the plants in a totally natural way and like hydroponics, aquaponics is considered to be more sustainable as more plants can be grown per square metre compared to normal agriculture. However, as is the case with normal agriculture, in aquaponics plants are grown within horizontally. In aquaponics, using the UVI system, the ratio between fish tanks:filters:plant tanks is 2:1:5 which means that the plant tanks are occupying close to half of the production space. In order to reduce the spatial requirement for plants, which would make production even more sustainable, this research investigates aspects of combining living wall and vertical farming technologies in aquaponics. It is considered that by growing the plants vertically less space would be required. In this research living wall system is investigated but the main focus is on the potentials of using various inert substrates in the living wall systems for vertical aquaponics. The results showed that a pot system performs better in terms of management of the systems. With regard to substrates, horticultural grade coconut fibre and horticultural grade mineral wool outperformed other substrates.},

Whilst research has indicated the plant grows well under greenhouse aquaponics conditions, as yet there has been no research on taste qualities. The aim of the study was thus to ascertain whether the taste of aquaponically grown bitter gourd is better or at least comparable with market-bought bitter gourd, grown abroad. Six adult participants participated in a blind taste test of 3 recipes of both aquaponically-grown bitter gourd and market-bought bitter gourd. The tests have shown that aquaponically grown bitter gourd is better and preferred in taste to the imported bitter gourd not grown aquaponically.},

The survey was conducted in Sharurah town situated in Najran province. The data were collected through a well-structured questionnaire from 100 respondents residing in the province. Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used to see the significant and non-significant impact of the two variables. The results showed that majority (37\%) of the respondents fell in the age group of 25–34 and majority (35\%) of the respondents have high level of education i.e. up to university level. The results also depicted that majority (31\%) of the people consume fish and were aware of the nutritional value of fish. However, majority (85\%) of the respondents were not satisfied by the fish price. The results further indicated that none of the respondent was engaged in fish farming activity i.e. they had no fish farms at their homes. Furthermore, majority (83\%) respondents had no intentions to start fish farming at their homes in future. The study concludes that fish consumption and preference is high in the study area and people prefer fish more than chicken and meat for consumption purposes because of their knowledge regarding the nutritional value of fish. However, the age and educational level have negative impact on the respondent's opinion about fish price in the study area. The study recommends that proper policies should be formulated to educate people about fish farming (aquaponics) and its importance through fisheries extension services to enhance the interest of people in fish farming.},

Moringa peregrina which is a medicinal plant, growing in arid region of Arabia, was assessed for the presence of endophytic bacterial strains. Results: PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rRNA of bacterial endophytes revealed the 5 endophytic bacteria, in which 2 strains were from Sphingomonas sp.; 2 strains from Bacillus sp. and 1 from Methylobacterium genus. Among the endophytic bacterial strains, a strain of Bacillus subtilis LK14 has shown significant prospects in phosphate solubilization (clearing zone of 56.71 mm after 5 d), ACC deaminase (448.3 ± 2.91 nM α-ketobutyrate mg-1 h-1) and acid phosphatase activity (8.4 ± 1.2 nM mg-1 min-1). The endophytic bacteria were also assessed for their potential to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Among isolated strains, the initial spectrophotometry analysis showed significantly higher IAA production by Bacillus subtilis LK14. The diurnal production of IAA was quantified using multiple reactions monitoring method in UPLC/MS–MS. The analysis showed that LK14 produced the highest (8.7 μM) IAA on 14th d of growth. Looking at LK14 potentials, it was applied to Solanum lycopersicum, where it significantly increased the shoot and root biomass and chlorophyll (a and b) contents as compared to control plants. Conclusion: The study concludes that using endophytic bacterial strains can be bio-prospective for plant growth promotion, which might be an ideal strategy for improving growth of crops in marginal lands.},

Currently, sustainable food supply is under intense pressure due to exponential population growth, expanding urban dwellings, climate change, and limited natural resources. The recent novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis has impacted sustainable fresh food supply, and has disrupted the food supply chain and prices significantly. Under these circumstances, urban horticulture and crop cultivation have emerged as potential ways to expand to new locations through urban green infrastructure. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review the salient features of contemporary urban horticulture, in addition to illustrating traditional and innovative developments occurring in urban environments. Current urban cropping systems, such as home gardening, community gardens, edible landscape, and indoor planting systems, can be enhanced with new techniques, such as vertical gardening, hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics, and rooftop gardening. These modern techniques are ecofriendly, energy- saving, and promise food security through steady supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables to urban neighborhoods. There is a need, in this modern era, to integrate information technology tools in urban horticulture, which could help in maintaining consistent food supply during (and after) a pandemic, as well as make agriculture more sustainable.},

In order to better understanding concerning the role of microorganism upon plant growth, this research was focused on the effect of microbial consortia inoculation on the yield of hydroponically water spinach (Ipomea aquatica Forssk) integrated with milk fish (Chanos chanos). The plant growth quality were determined to assess the efficacy of the beneficial microorganism. The experimental design was randomized blocks with five treatments which corresponded to the microbial consortia inoculation containing species of Lactobacillus, species of Bacillus, species of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter and combination of Lactobacillus casei and Saccharomyces cerevisae with three replicates. The result indicated that the water spinach with microbial consortia inoculation higher growth and yields than that of the uninoculated control significantly. However, it was not significantly different on plant yields from the species composition of microbial consortia. The results support the hypothesis that the use of microbial consortia can increase the yields efficiency of aquaponically water spinach. In interesting implication of result findings was that in the aquaponics system, the milk fish can be coupled with the water spinach growing system since its benefits were not dependent upon continuous recirculation between the plant and fish system but also its living biotic community.},

The present study was conducted to evaluate the growth performance of monosex Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in ASTAF-PRO compared to an earthen pond as a positive control. The present results indicated that there was a significant increase in the final weight and final length of monosex Nile tilapia compared to the initial values in both groups with a remarkable increase in the average weight and length over time. The weight gain and length gain were higher for the fish reared in pond compared to aquaponic which could be linked to culture condition (habitat) since the same feed was used. Feed conversion ratio, condition factor, specific growth rate and survival rate were comparable (p {$>$} 0.05) in both groups. This means that both culture conditions for O. niloticus did not negatively affect the examined growth performance variables. Final net productivity was 42.5 kg m-3 for ASTAF-PRO system and 43 kg m-3 for POND system, at fish capacity of 227 fish m-3 for ASTAF-PRO and 166 fish m-3 for pond system. However, ASTAF-PRO unit had vegetable crop as secondary product, which increase profitability of the system, in addition of overwhelming superiority of ASTAF-PRO in water saving. This result indicates that ASTAF-PRO as an aquaponics system can compete traditional pond culture technique on large-scale farming.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture has experienced a burgeoning growth worldwide in the last decade resulting in nearly 50\% of seafood originating from aquaculture farms. However, there are less studies on the utilization of the manure produced by aquatic organisms in comparison to warm-blooded livestock. Aquaponics offers more efficient utilization of nutrients and can reduce the operational costs in aquaculture. This paper presents the results of a study to identify the optimal settings to digest fish manure through a microbial-assisted aerobic bioprocess, using endogenous heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria. The effects of pH (5.5, 6.0 and 6.5), temperature (30, 35 and 40 °C) and duration (1–30 days) on kinetics of nitrogen mineralization were investigated and compared to a control bioreactor (carried out without pH adjustment). The mineralization dynamics for all pH-controlled bioreactors revealed that only ammonification occurred. No nitrification was observed for all three-temperature conditions and throughout the entire bioprocessing period. The mineralization process in the control bioreactor, on the other hand, followed the typical non-inhibited nitrogen mineralization (i.e., release of ammonium followed by oxidation into nitrate). However, nitrate was only observed at temperatures \textbackslash textless40 °C indicating a complete suppression of nitrification at higher temperatures. Analytical data and modeled parameters indicated that the bioprocessing of aquaculture solid waste for 15 days at 35 °C using either pH 6.0 or 6.5 maximized nitrogen bioconversion in the form of ammonium ions (NH4+). This study indicates the importance of temperature and pH optimization for more efficient processing of aquaculture solid waste such as fish manure.},

The small-scale experimental design investigated the effects of 2 biochar media sizes (1 – 3 mm [referred to as fine biochar] and 3 – 5 mm [referred to as coarse biochar]), 3 biochar bed heights (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 cm) and 3 loading rates (5, 10 and 15 m3/m2/d) on particle size distribution as well as turbidity removal efficiency. Both biochar sizes (fine and coarse) were able to clarify fish effluent. However, fine biochar led to better filtration characteristics compared to coarse biochar. Results indicated that biochar filter bed heights and loading rates affected the filtration performances. Using deeper filters combined with lower loading rates led to greater removal of suspended particles and turbidity compared to shallower filters and/or higher loading rates. Results from the large-scale filtration, using a mixture of fine and coarse biochar media (size of 1 – 5 mm), revealed that the ideal loading rate for maximizing the removal of turbidity from fish effluent in high-intensity aquaponic system for production of Nile tilapia and greenhouse plants (with 80 m3 total volume of water, 40 kg/m3 average stocking density and 15 kg/d feeding rate) was 10 m3/m2/d. This study suggests that biochar-based filtration could be incorporated into aquaponics as a polishing step before sending the water to plant growth systems.},

The catfish (Silurus asotus) were cultured in the urban aquaculture system using BFT (Biofloc Technology) aquaculture and an aquaponics system (two rearing tanks, 3 tons each) without exchanging the rearing water. After 151 days (from March to August) of rearing, 2.8 g of fry had grown to an average weight of 171.3 g (total weight, 56.53 kg) and 235.5 g (total weight 71.1 kg), respectively. The overall survival rate was 65\% in the urban aquaculture system. However, the survival rate was 77.7\% before separation into the two tanks. The survival rates after the separation were 92.9\% and 78.0\%. In the early biofloc watermaking process, there was a high mortality rate. After water stabilization, the mortality rate decreased and some mortality occurred during the period when the total amount of suspended solids (TSS) increased. The results of monthly blood analysis of the catfish showed that the AST concentration was significantly higher in April. Blood ALT levels and triglycerides showed no difference in the rearing period and the glucose, cholesterol, and total protein levels were significantly higher in July. There was no difference in the other periods. The plants produced by the aquaponics system using catfish-rearing water were lettuce, basil, chard, and red chicory. These showed smooth growth and a total of 148.85 kg of plants were harvested in five months. It was possible to remove nitric acid from the aquaponics system and reuse it as catfish-rearing water. Maintaining proper plant quantity according to the capacity of the catfish showed that the combination of agricultural and aquatic products was possible.},

  abstract = {Pure ammonia is a gas which is highly soluble in water. As a base, under neutral conditions it exists as ammonium ion, which, at low external concentrations is a preferential nitrogen source for most plants but at higher concentrations it is phytotoxic. Since ammonia is continuously produced in living plant cells by different biochemical processes, several routes evolved for its detoxification. However, even the most active detoxification pathways cannot protect the plants against high concentrations of ammonia applied exogenously under the conditions of phytoremediation and aquaponics. Phytoremediation and aquaponics are new, emerging, ecofriendly technologies that exploit the high stress tolerance of plants by growing them under atypical, occasionally highly stressful conditions. Phytoremediation uses living higher plants for cleaning up contaminated soil and water by removing, sequestering, or biochemically decomposing the pollutant. Aquaponics integrates hydroponics (plant production in water, without soil) and traditional aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, crayfish or prawns in tanks), providing a symbiotic environment for producing fish and plants in a closed system. In phytoremediation plants may be exposed to a wide range of pollutants while in aquaponics the usual phytotoxic pollutant is ammonia produced by the fish.},

  abstract = {Our modern cities are resource sinks designed on the current linear economic model which recovers very little of the original input. As the current model is not sustainable, a viable solution is to recover and reuse parts of the input. In this context, resource recovery using nature-based solutions (NBS) is gaining popularity worldwide. In this specific review, we focus on NBS as technologies that bring nature into cities and those that are derived from nature, using (micro)organisms as principal agents, provided they enable resource recovery. The findings presented in this work are based on an extensive literature review, as well as on original results of recent innovation projects across Europe. The case studies were collected by participants of the COST Action Circular City, which includes a portfolio of more than 92 projects. The present review article focuses on urban wastewater, industrial wastewater, municipal solid waste and gaseous effluents, the recoverable products (e.g., nutrients, nanoparticles, energy), as well as the implications of source separation and circularity by design. The analysis also includes assessment of the maturity of different technologies (technology readiness level) and the barriers that need to be overcome to accelerate the transition to resilient, self-sustainable cities of the future.},

  abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of aqua-architecture’s key components, providing autonomous functioning of a floating structure as an artificial full-cycle ecosystem. The leading approach to the study is a systematic analysis of the stages maintaining the complete ecological cycle: production of primary products, energy storage, waste management and operation control. The analysis of each stage is accompanied by the examples of built and conceptual projects of architectural structures on the water from the world’s architectural practice. The research shows that it is necessary to include the production systems based on the usage of water resources at every stage. At the stage of primary products and water obtainment, it is advisable to provide aeroponic, aquaponic, hydroponic farms and water desalination plants. To obtain energy in the autonomous structure, it is necessary to organize floating solar farms, underwater hydropower and wind turbines. The disposal stage involves the installation of biogas facilities, hydro-botanical ponds and waste recycling systems. The fourth component of the full ecological cycle is smart management, the automation of which allows the whole system to function independently at any stage. Water resources can also be involved in transport and logistics processes as well as in microclimate maintenance. The materials of this study will be useful for further theoretical and practical developments in the field of eco-sustainable design in the extreme environments.},

  abstract = {This article presents the prototype design and testing of a long-range, self-powered IoT devices for use in precision agriculture and aquaponics. The devices are designed using the ultra-low power nRF52840 microcontroller with Bluetooth 5 support and ambient energy harvesting. A power of 942µW is harvested in an indoor environment. The devices are therefore suitable for both indoor and outdoor use, as natural sunlight will provide far more energy compared to artificial indoor lights. A line-of-sight range of up to 1.8km is achieved with the use of coded transmissions. However, the coverage area and range can be extended significantly by deploying the devices in multihop network topology. The custom multi-hop protocol provides energy efficient communication from any device in a wireless sensor network to a gateway while consuming an average of 267µW with a transmission interval of 5 minutes. The sensor data is transmitted to a gateway, which then forwards it to a local server or cloud service, where the data can be analyzed to optimize the production in agriculture and aquaponics.},

  abstract = {Due to the cyclic or systemic nature of both aquaponics and organic production, organic certification appears to be a natural step for a researcher, system designer or commercial-oriented aquaponics producer to engage in. However, the underlying principles and justifications of aquaponics and organic production differ considerably between respectively a technological- and a soil-based understanding of nutrient cycles and long-term sustainability in food production. These principles are confirmed in both the organic regulation regime of the EU and USA, and presently leave the question ambiguously open as to whether aquaponics as a food production system can be recognized and certified as organic. Despite an openness in the organic regulation for new knowledge, adaptations and innovations, the organic sector itself has shown a reluctance to recognize more knowledge-based intensive speciality crops and technologies. This is particularly difficult with respect to small organic sub-sectors such as horticulture and aquaculture production. Both are very specific subsystems of the agricultural sector, where aquaponics potentially would belong at the intersection between organic greenhouse horticulture and organic aquaculture. Organically certified aquaponics would therefore need to establish a niche within the organic sector. So in order to move forward, there is a great need for a more serious but open-minded exchange and discussion among the aquaponics and organic sub-sectors themselves to explore the potential but also limitations of their respective production models. However, between the two food production systems, there should be room for debate with a view to finding new and feasible roles for aquaponics in the organic community.},

In this perspective paper, we argue that more attention is needed for the inclusion and exclusion effects of Agriculture 4.0 technologies, and for reflection on how they relate to diverse transition pathways towards sustainable agricultural and food systems driven by mission-oriented innovation systems. This would require processes of responsible innovation, anticipating the potential impacts of Agriculture 4.0 through inclusive processes, and reflecting on and being responsive to emerging effects and where needed adjusting the direction and course of transition pathways.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture is globally the fastest growing sector of agriculture that needs to be sustainable and must also meet bioeconomic demands. In principle, aquaponics, the combination of aquaculture and horticulture within a single recirculating aquaponic system (SRAPS), provides a sustainable approach; however, it has lower productivity of both fish and plants in comparison to separate recirculating systems. The aim of our new concept for aquaponics is to improve sustainability and productivity concomitant with lowering environmental emissions. The aquaponic system for (nearly) emission free tomato and fish production in greenhouses (ASTAF-PRO) is a new combination of systemic parts, consisting of 2 independent recirculating units: an aquaculture system (RAS) for fish and a hydroponic unit for plants. Both systems are connected by a 1-way valve to deliver fish water containing nutrients into the hydroponic reservoir, where the fish water can be optimized as fertilizer in order to meet specific demands of the plant species. Thus, our double recirculation aquaponic system (DRAPS) can provide optimum conditions for both parts to increase productivity and to prevent any adverse interactions between plant and fish units. Water use is minimized by condensing the plant evapo-transpired water via air conditioning and returning it into the RAS. Testing of the ASTAF-PRO prototype successfully demonstrated the principle using a combination of tilapia and tomato production. Tilapia productivity was similar to single RAS, while tomato production at least indicated the potential for similar efficiency to conventional hydroponics. Thus, ASTAF-PRO improves sustainability and productivity while lowering environmental emissions, and might promote future application of aquaponics for food security.},

Fish batch production under different stocking densities in an extensive aquacultural unit (EAU) and an intensive aquacultural unit (IAU) was connected to conventional plant cultivation on ebb-and-flood planting tables and compared to a liquid fertilizer control. The best growth parameters of M. spicata were found under the intensive stocking density of C. gariepinus (IAU), resulting in a plant leaf area of 10.9 ± 2.5 cm2, leaf length of 8.6 ± 1.6 cm, and a cut fresh biomass from aboveground of 31.8 ± 13.8 g/plant, compared to the EAU (5.6 ± 2.1 cm2; 5.4 ± 1.4 cm; 17.4 ± 4.7 g/plant) and the control (5.7 ± 2.2 cm2; 5.5 ± 1.4 cm; 11.2 ± 5.3 g/plant). The fresh biomass of the whole plants was not significantly different between the EAU (165.5 ± 71.7 g/plant) and the IAU (190.7 ± 105.6 g/plant), though the latter gained more weight. The initial fish number ratio between the EAU and the IAU of 1/4 increased the M. spicata leaf area by twofold in the IAU. Our results demonstrate that aquaponics (s.l.) production of M. spicata is possible under the direct use of effluent waters from intensive African catfish cultivation without the addition of any liquid fertilizer.},

After 41 days, plants were significantly taller in the gravel components (101.8 ± 8.3 cm), followed by the grow pipes (96.7 ± 7.0 cm), and the raft (94.8 ± 8.6 cm) components (gravel {$>$} grow pipes = raft).

Basil in the grow-pipe subsystems developed rapid root growth and clogged the pipes with heterogeneous plant growth. Basil production in northern Germany in grow-pipe, raft, and gravel hydro-components is possible by using effluents from intensive C. gariepinus aquaculture without additional fertilizer in the plant grow-out phase. Further research should focus on optimizing grow pipes by maintaining an optimal root–water contact area, as well as on new technologies such as aquaponics (s.l.) gardening.},

The daily feed input increased over the experiment (70–450 g, total 70 days), resulting in an maximum feed input of 150 g d−1, or 25\% less than during an earlier study under the presence of a 60 L trickling biofilter.

Lowest dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were measured inside the hydroponic units, with no general differences in chemo-physical parameters between each separate plant box. Nile tilapia red strain fingerlings (Oreochromis niloticus; initial weight 3.32 g ± 1.63) were stocked in aquaponic unit I and African catfish fingerlings (Clarias gariepinus; initial weight 3.92 g ± 1.63) in unit II. Due to the high feed input at the beginning of the experiments, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio were very good, and significantly better for C. gariepinus (3.30\% d−1 ± 0.02, 0.61 ± 0.01) compared with O. niloticus (2.81\% d−1 ± 0.12, 0.91 ± 0.08). Feed conversion corresponded with much younger fish with effective feeding under restricted food input. The oxygen consumption was lower for C. gariepinus with a difference of 8.34\% to O. niloticus. Due to reduced natural light illumination and water temperature (winter season), plant growth was generally reduced but two times better in the O. niloticus stocked unit (0.30 g ± 0.37 in basil, 0.55 g ± 0.39 in parsley) compared with C. gariepinus (0.12 g ± 0.21 in basil, 0.27 g ± 0.31 in parsley).

Growth of O. niloticus (unit I) was better (p \textbackslash textless 0.05) in final weight (57.4 g ± 27.9), final biomass (27,683.3 g ± 160.7), specific growth rate (0.70\% d− 1± 0.01) and feed conversion ratio (1.31 ± 0.02) in comparison to C. carpio (unit II, 42.7 g ± 22.2, 21,866.7 g ± 568.6, 0.39\% d− 1± 0.02, 2.69 ± 0.20). Tomato gross biomass was two times higher in combination with O. niloticus and tomato fruit weight was slightly higher. Plant growth in cucumber showed higher total fresh biomass in the C. carpio unit. Lettuce yield was near zero as a result of inter-specific competition. The Aquaponic Growth Factor (AGF), describing the growth performance of fish and plant combinations, was highest in tomato (1.12) combined with O. niloticus compared with C. carpio (0.53). However, the AGF of cucumber was slightly higher in combination with C. carpio (0.14) compared with O. niloticus (0.12). This study demonstrates best plant growth for the combination of O. niloticus with tomato and C. carpio with cucumber. The unit stocked with C. carpio had higher levels of oxygen (6.3 mg L− 1± 0.8) and oxygen saturation (78.6\% ± 8.4) in contrast to O. niloticus (5.8 mg L− 1± 0.8, 73.2\% ± 8.9). The long steady state of dissolved oxygen inside both units allowed a higher daily feed input of 0.3\% of fish initial biomass during spring and summer seasons, 25\% above the optimal feed input estimated for the same units during winter time (0.9\% = 150 g). C. carpio extended the equilibrium phase during plant production before a significant oxygen drop occurred, beneficial for coupled aquaponics. Different growth performance of fish and plant combinations suggest multiple fish species use or polyponics (polyculture + aquaponics) in coupled aquaponics to increase plant yield. Statement of relevance Different fish species used in identical aquaponic systems change oxygen levels and alter plant species growth. We herewith confirm this for two further fish species, and suggest combined fish species cultivation (polyponics) in coupled aquaponics to increase plant performance.},

  abstract = {Two identical coupled ebb-and-flow gravel substrate aquaponics units (each 3.81 m3 –domestic backyard) were tested for extensive fish and herb productivity under autumn conditions in northern Germany (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were stocked in unit I with 10,033.3±305.5 g (number 226, initial weight 35.0±18.1 g) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in unit II with 10,333.3±757.2 g (number 309, initial weight 26.5±9.9 g) initial biomass and a daily feed input of 200 g or 52.5 g m-3 of system water volume (19.9 g feed per kg fish day-1 and 2.0\% feed for C. carpio; 19.4 g feed per kg fish day-1 and 1.9\% feed for O. niloticus). Fish growth parameters were higher in O. niloticus (final biomass 19,450.0±50.0 g, SGR 0.91±0.10\% d-1, FCR 1.54±0.14) than in C. carpio (final biomass 18,000.0±50.0 g, SGR 0.84±0.05\% d-1, FCR 1.76±0.07). Mint yield (Mentha piperita) was 1.8 times higher (20.7±18.0 g) in the O. niloticus unit (II), and basil (Ocimum basilicum) yield was slightly higher in combination with C. carpio (22.1±17.5 g) than with O. niloticus (16.1±13.8 g). Parsley production (Petroselinum crispum) was below expectations, but yield was 2.4 times higher combined with C. carpio (1.2±1.1 g) than with O. niloticus (0.5±0.5 g). The different fish species affected the aquaponics system’s stability with higher dissolved oxygen levels, a longer steady state phase and higher nitrate levels in the C. carpio unit. This experiment demonstrates a different influence of C. carpio and O. niloticus on plant growth expressed by the Aquaponic Growth Factor (AGF), which was higher for O. niloticus only with mint (0.84) in contrast to C. carpio with basil (0.37) and parsley (1.44). The combined use of different fish species in one coupled aquaponics system can compensate for lower growth rates of fish (C. carpio) with a better plant growth of basil and parsley with regard to economical gross output. This form of aquaponics production combines polyculture with aquaponics (POLYPONICs) and can increase the overall yield of the system for sustainable production in aquaponics.},

Spearmint leaf number was significantly higher in the grow pipes (770.0 ± 224.4) than in the gravel substrate (499.8 ± 228.4) with intermediate values in the raft. Significantly highest mean fresh biomass was found in the raft (1275.6 ± 33.4 g), followed by grow pipes (1042.0 ± 35.8 g) and gravel substrate (686.3 ± 98.2 g; raft {$>$} grow pipes {$>$} gravel). M. spicata, under aquaponics, grows best in grow pipe and raft components. An increase in pipe diameter for the grow pipes and a reduction in the channel height for the raft components could optimize aquaponic culture conditions for both industrial production and the hobby sector in the future.},

While it is perceived as a way to contribute to more sustainable food systems, the technology is still in its infancy, with several challenges. This paper describes current conditions of development and identifies aspects that can promote or hinder future pathways. We focus our analysis on the EU, using Germany as an institutional case study, while also considering worldwide developments. We propose a framework to analyze aquaponics as an emerging technological innovation system at the interface between existing fish and plant production systems. The approach is explorative based on a literature review and interviews with experts. The main findings are that stakeholders have different views regarding the future development pathways, knowledge to manage complex systems in the long term is needed and it is still unclear how to design institutional conditions to deliver sustainable outcomes.},

It evaluates the impacts of either using different greenhouse materials (e.g. for the cover or screens) or building a complete new structure on the overall energy consumption and crop yield. The system is constructed as an easy to use software tool based upon a set of simulation model modules for greenhouse energy fluxes, crop growth and yield. The user defines the structure of his present greenhouse from the pre-defined menu. This greenhouse is then used as reference greenhouse that can be compared to the various modifications of it that the user selects. The entering of additional variables such as geographic location (country), type of crop, internal greenhouse climate set points etc. allow simulations of energy consumption and crop yield over a period of one year using reference climate data of the respective location as input to be performed. The system is constructed in a way such that the database of greenhouse construction materials can be updated easily to maintain its applicability.},

For validation and test, the model system was built in small scale at the site of Copenhagen University, Denmark, i.e. a greenhouse compartment of 100 m2 with three fish ponds dimensioned to the size needed for crop irrigation using a combination of leafy vegetables and herbs, and two varieties of fish, i.e. pike perch (Sander lucioperca) and tilapia. The modelled combined system was implemented in a greenhouse simulator environment (The Virtual Greenhouse). Simulation studies where performed with the full model using tomato crop and a variation of fish cultures; i.e. the aquaculture ponds were set to a range of constant water temperatures for separate scenario studies, increasing with 2°C from 14 to 34°C. A standard Venlo type shelter of 1000 m2 was used for that. The aquaculture system was dimensioned to the crops need of nutrients such that it produces 9 Mt tilapia fish yearly of which a peak system biomass content of 3t fish system-1 was calculated. The fish feed was given to the optimum and the minimum intake capacity of fresh water at 12°C was calculated from transpiration and evaporation losses, as other water was recycled in the closed system. Simulation results indicate that greenhouse climate is influenced through the aquaculture system with increased humidity levels and decreased use of energy for heating and CO2 supply. The amount of energy saving for greenhouse heating increases with fish pond water temperature, while due to the metabolic activity inside the aquaculture system energy consumption for heating the water increased only little in that range. Total energy saving (energy for greenhouse heating and the aquaponics system) increases almost linear with increased pond temperature with 41 MJ m-2 K-1 year-1. The developed model is useful for planning aquaponic systems and can be used as input model for predictive climate control in greenhouses with combined aquaculture production.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse energy-saving and biocide reduction can be achieved through dynamic greenhouse climate control with computerized model-based regimes. This can be optimized when next to greenhouse macroclimate (i.e., the aerial environment) also, the crop microclimate is predicted. The aim of this article was to design and apply a simple deterministic microclimate model for dynamic greenhouse climate control concepts. The model calculates crop temperature and latent heat of evaporation in different vertical levels of a dense canopy of potted plants. The model was validated with data attained from experiments on dynamic or nondynamic (regular) controlled greenhouse cultivation. Crop temperature was with a 95\% confidence interval of 2 8C or 2.4 8C for sunlit or shaded leaves, respectively, accurately predicted in a simple greenhouse with predefined climate set points. With a more dynamic greenhouse control also including assimilation lighting and screens, the prediction quality decreased but still had a 95\% confidence interval of crop temperature prediction of 3.8 8C for sunlit leaves. Simulations showed that controlling greenhouse temperature according to the predicted crop temperature rather than according to the air temperature can save energy. Energysaving is highest during winter and 12\% energy saving was attained during January under Danish climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Botrytis cinerea is one of the most common plant pathogenic fungi that affects a wide range of greenhouse horticultural products and decreases their market value. B. cinerea can strongly decrease yield and post-harvest quality through latent infections. It is a highly water dependent fungus and a certain leaf wetness duration seems necessary for spore germination. However, during germination before building of the inocolum durations of dryness (desiccation) can kill the spores. To avoid grey mould disease incidence, the relative humidity set point is generally kept low. This costs high amounts of energy through dehumidification by heating and ventilating the greenhouses. Therefore, to control grey mould with climate control in a more specific way to save energy, a mathematical model simulating the microclimate in the greenhouse crop was used. The model calculates durations of leaf wetness and leaf dryness. The prediction of leaf wetness incidence is based on modelled leaf temperature at different locations in the crop and the dew point temperature. Duration of leaf wetness (i.e. time to dry out) is computed from the energy balance of latent heat on the leaf surface. Climate control is then optimised for energy saving and grey mould prevention. In the present paper, a simulation study was performed to test the performance of the model on greenhouse microclimate and energy saving. Simulations with a set of yearly reference climate data of Denmark showed high amounts of energy saving.},

  abstract = {New greenhouse technology develops fast and there are many new possibilities to reduce greenhouse energy consumption. The most energy savings can usually be achieved when investing in new construction with the newest technology of energy harvesting, storage and re-usage. In existing greenhouses, however, a high energy reduction is also possible. Some energy savings are possible by simply optimising the climate set points, but in some situations, larger savings can be achieved by installing some of the newest equipment. At the same time, plant growth and quality must not decrease due to lower greenhouse energy consumption. To support the growers in decision-making processes, greenhouses need to be individually analysed for modification. We developed an internet-based software tool to analyse greenhouse energy performance and pinpoint the bottlenecks, identifying the possibilities for reducing the energy consumption of existing greenhouses by either software or hardware measures. Thus, a decision support system (DSS) was created that accesses greenhouse climate computer data that can, after input of greenhouse physical data, be used to analyse the effects of modifications in greenhouse materials, crop schedules, climate set points, and others on energy consumption and crop yield. The system consists of a large number of independently developed simulation models that are integrated to one working system. Models of greenhouse physics, crop-specific growth, plant development and quality, crop microclimate, different environmental stresses, e.g. heat- or waterstress, and more are involved.},

Parris Island), under Mediterranean climate conditions. In both seasons, plants were cultivated hydroponically under four different levels of photosynthetically active radiation intensities (26, 47, 73 and 100 \% of incident light intensity). The results showed that stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate significantly decreased in shaded plants. This strong negative correlation of leaf physiological parameters with light deficiency resulted in lower biomass yield production in both growing seasons. Moreover, the nutritional value (ascorbic acid concentration) was also significantly decreased in relation to incident light intensity decrease. In contrary, a strong positive correlation of leaf total chlorophyll content and nitrate content with light deficiency was detected. However, nitrate concentration in all treatments remained within the European Union’s permissible levels being significantly lower in plants produced in spring compared to winter.},

During the experiment, the media were aerated and changes in the pH and conductivity of the water were closely monitored. E2 promoted the growth of S. quadricauda and L. minor, with significant accumulation of high-value biomolecules at very low steroid concentrations. However, clear differences in growth performance were observed in both test cultures, S. quadricauda and L. minor, grown in different media, and the most effective hormone concentrations were evidently different for the algae and the plant.},

  abstract = {Objective: The article presents a discussion on the aquaponics technology, including its working principles and applications in farming as well as the trends and challenges associated with its use in different areas of agriculture. Methods/statistical analysis: In this work, we discuss aquaponics, a combination of two techniques: a. ‘hydroponic’, which means cultivating plants/vegetables without soil, and b. ‘aquaculture’, which means fish farming. Aquaponics has become a popular technique because of its similarities to natural ecosystem, where the only difference is that it is a controlled system, in which the fish eats and produce ammonia, beneficial bacteria convert ammonia produced by the fish into nutrients, and the plant absorbs the natural fertilizer and the nutrients. In addition, the water carrying the ammonia and nutrients is continuously recirculated through the system. Findings: The present study was conducted to explore and find a better way to apply the aquaponics agriculture system in various agriculture industries. Findings show that this method enhances the benefits and eliminates the many drawbacks that occur in traditional soil-based agriculture. Application/improvement: This agriculture system does not depend on the soil, and no pesticide is required during the farming. This system is suitable for year-round farming and can produce high-quality vegetables at a much higher yield rate. Vegetables grow at a much faster rate using this technique, compared traditional farming techniques. Aquaponics takes place in a closed system and there is no discharge of waste into the stream. This system produces up to 30\% more production compared to traditional farming using the same amount of space. This system requires less water compared to traditional farming.},

The growth performance of a fish along with certain leafy vegetables will be tested and the result will be estimated during the recirculation of the system with respect to the temperature and the effective use of the fish excretion. Arduino usually acts as the brain of the system and that being used in aquaponic helps us to receive the information from the sensors and reciprocate as instructions with respect to feedback. Later, actions will be initiated based on the systems actuator. Aquaponics is an inexpensive symbiotic cycle between the living organism and the crop. In this system Fish excretion (ammonia) is incorporated into the plant bed which in turn acts as the biofilter and grasps the nitrate that is crucial for vegetation. Then the fresh water is returned to restart the cycle. The Fish is fed with pellets that contains 30\% of the crude proteins that enhances almost all the nutrients that are required for efficient plant growth.},

Sometimes, the benefits of hydroponics have been questioned by the researchers as compared to growing of crops in other soilless culture. The growers raised the crops through hydroponics system get yields more compared to conventional practices as hydroponically grown plants dip their roots directly into nutrient-rich solutions. Therefore, the aim of the current chapter is to provide accurate and updated information about their different nutrients and their composition used hydroponically compared to conventional production mode. This chapter will be divided as the following sections: (1) rationale, (2) nutrient solution technique, and (3) work done on fruit crops. With this chapter, we hope to present an updated information, comparing hydroponic versus conventional technique.},

  abstract = {Limitation in the availability of natural resources like water is the main drive for focussing on resource recovery from wastewater. Rapid urbanization with increased consumption of natural resources has severely affected its management and security. The application of biotechnological processes offers a feasible approach to concentrating and transforming wastewater for resource recovery and a step towards a circular economy. Wastewater generally contains high organic materials, nutrients, metals and chemicals, which have economic value. Hence, its management can be a valuable resource through the implementation of a paradigm transformation for value-added product recovery. This review focuses on the circular economy of “close loop” process by wastewater reuse and energy recovery identifying the emerging technologies for recovering resources across the wastewater treatment phase. Conventional wastewater treatment technologies have been discussed along with the advanced treatment technologies such as algal treatment, anammox technology, microbial fuel cells (MFC). Apart from recovering energy in the form of biogas and biohydrogen, second and third-generation biofuels as well as biohythane and electricity generation have been deliberated. Other options for resource recovery are single-cell protein (SCP), biopolymers as well as recovery of metals and nutrients. The paper also highlights the applications of treated wastewater in agriculture, aquaponics, fisheries and algal cultivation.},

  abstract = {Despite impressive increase in global grain production since 1960s, there are 795 million food-i­nsecure and \textasciitilde 2 billion people prone to malnutrition. Further, global population of 7.4 billion in 2016 is projected to increase to 9.7 billion by 2050, with almost all increase occurring in developing countries. Thus, it is recommended that global food production be increased by 60 to 70\% between 2005 and 2050. Global crop production increased threefold between 1965 and 2015 with a net increase of only 67 million ha (Mha) of cropland area. Nonetheless, agronomic yield of food staples can still be tripled or quadrupled in Sub-S­ aharan Africa (SSA), South Asia (SA), and the Caribbean by a widespread adoption of site-s­pecific best management practices of sustainable intensification (SI). Rather than expanding the area under cropland, agriculturally marginal and degraded soils can be set aside for nature conservancy. The global average cereal yield of 3.27 Mg ha−1 in 2005 can be increased to 5 Mg ha−1 by 2050, 6 Mg ha−1 by 2080 and 7 Mg ha−1 by 2100 through SI of agroecosystems in SSA, SA and elsewhere. The strategy of “producing more from less” necessitates restoration of soil health and increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration to be more than 1.5–2.0\% in the rootzone. The goal of SOC sequestration is in accord with the “4 per Thousand” initiative proposed at COP21 in 2015. Therefore, global food demands can be met despite the decreasing trends in the per capita cropland area by 2050 – 0.17 ha in the world and 0.15 ha in developing countries. While enhancing productivity by SI, the strategy is to simultaneously reduce food waste, increase access and distribution of food, and promote plant-­based diet. The goal is to reconcile high production with better environmental quality, develop urban agriculture (aquaponics, aeroponics, and vertical farms), promote nutrition-­sensitive farming, and restore degraded soils. Sustainable intensification of agroecosystems can produce enough food grains to feed one person for a year on 0.045 ha of arable land.},

Increased fish growth (2.4 g/day), vegetable yield (22 kg/harvest), and nutrient removal (83\% ammonia-N removal, 87\% nitrite-N removal, 70\% nitrate-N removal, 60\% removal of total phosphorus, 88\% removal of total suspended solid, 63\% removal of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand) were observed at high component ratio (3 m3/m3). Component ratio was found to have a significant influence on nutrient removal and production of marble goby and water spinach in RAS. A component ratio of !3 m3 of hydroponic tank volume to 1 m3 of fish rearing tank volume showed advantages in improving the production of the fish and vegetable and removing the nutrient wastes, TSS, and BOD5 generated from the culture of the fish.

The fish cultured in big partitions with PVC tubes showed higher growth (2.5 g/d) and feed intake (468 g/d) than other tank designs (growth: 62.2 g/d; feed intake: 6433 g/d). The growth of fish fed with live tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (2.5 g/d) was significantly higher than that of fish fed with live carp (Cyprinus carpio) (1.9 g/d) and minced scads (Decapterus russellii) (1.6 g/d). Fish fed with minced scads showed the highest waste production (ammonia nitrogen (TAN): 262 mg/kg d; 5-d biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5): 434 mg DO/kg d; total suspended solid (TSS): 2.1 g/ kg d) compared to those fed with live food (tilapia and carp) (TAN: 6208 mg/kg d; BOD5: 6344 mg DO/kg d; TSS: 61.9 g/kg d). Live food, particularly tilapia, was found to be the preferential diet for marble goby as indicated by the highest fish growth (2.5 g/d) and feed utilization (feed conversion efficiency (FCE): 0.46), and the lowest waste production (TAN: 140 mg/ kg d; BOD5: 232 mg DO/kg d; TSS: 1.4 g/kg d) compared to that of fish fed with minced fish (growth: 61.6 g/d; FCE: 60.31; TAN: P198 mg/kg d; BOD5: P328 mg DO/kg d; TSS: P1.9 g/ kg d).

According to the results of daily observation, the fish behavior was adequate until the end of the experiment, which was stopped with the beginning of their mass death (more than 20\%). Researches have shown the promise of using the indicator of total antioxidant activity to assess the work of the closed containment aquaculture system for hydrobionts farming. The issues of reducing the cost of farmed fish by the closed containment aquaculture system using aquaponics, which distinguished among other technologies by the high quality of environmentally friendly food products while significantly saving water resources which is an important problem for closed containment aquaculture system are considered. Food plants feed on bacteria from the waste products of fish while they consume the necessary secretion products from water – chemicals (nitrogenous, potassium, phosphorus compounds), naturally purifying the water. Aquaponics simulates the natural whirlpool, using the natural processes of fish vital functions for plants nutrient medium. As food plants can be used Salicornia europaea and glycophyte Nasturtium officinale, which has a high productivity and high content of vitamins, iron and glycosides. Both plants are tested in the closed containment aquaculture system including human, increased degree of isolation.},

Cette étude préliminaire  cherche, d’une part, à établir les fondements nécessaires pour une production de doré rentable  et, d’autre part, à mettre à l’épreuve les techniques d’élevage actuellement en vigueur ailleurs  dans le monde. Deux systèmes de circulation d’eau ont été comparés soit, un circuit ouvert où  l’eau est continuellement renouvelée et un circuit fermé où l’eau est majoritairement filtrée et  réutilisée. De plus, quatre traitements alimentaires ont été comparés, soit (a) une moulée à base  de protéines animales, (b) un traitement où des artémies ont été ajoutées à la moulée, (c) un  traitement où un extrait de raisin a été ajouté à la moulée et (d) une moulée à base de protéine  végétale. Les résultats indiquent que (i) le circuit fermé offre un potentiel intéressant pour  l’élevage intensif des larves de dorés, (ii) la moulée à base de protéine animale offre une  croissance optimale des larves, (iii) la moulée à base de protéine végétale offre une croissance  inférieure, mais une meilleure survie, (iv) l’ajout d’artémies ne stimule pas clairement l’ingestion  alimentaire et (v) l’ajout d’extrait de raisin n’améliore pas la survie des larves.

  abstract = {Water quality monitoring, assessment, and analysis in an aquaponics system are vital procedures in maintaining a productive and an efficient ecosystem for cultivars being cultured. However, these require laborintensive, long-standing, and high-priced laboratory methods, as water quality and its nutrients are dependent on microbiological and physio-chemical variables. To reduce the use of costly sensors and the time consumed for expensive calculations, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based aquaphotomics approach is conducted on this study. Water samples were collected from a pond water of an aquaponics system (AP) where species of fish are cultivated. The samples went through aquaphotomics with the aid of spectrophotometer and was applied on to near infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet (NIR-Vis-UV) spectrum with wavelength range of 100 to 1000 nm. Spectrometry was utilized to determine three significant nutrient compounds which are the nitrate, phosphate, and potassium. Temperature, power of hydrogen (pH), and electrical conductivity sensors (EC) were used simultaneously to serve as data attributes in predicting the three compounds assigned as targets. Feature selection algorithms such as Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) and Univariate Feature Ranking for Regression Using F-Tests (UFT) were used to determine the two most significant predictor relative to a specific target. Results showed that MRMR with ANFIS is best used for predicting Phosphate with ������������ value of 0.8284. The UFT with ANFIS produced the best performance for regressing Nitrate and Potassium with ������������ values of 0.9321 and 0.9961 respectively.},

  abstract = {Classification of lettuce life or growth stages is an effective tool for measuring the performance of an aquaponics system. It determines the balance in water nutrients, adequate temperature and lighting, other environmental factors, and the system’s productivity to sustain cultivars. This paper proposes a classification of lettuce life stages planted in an aquaponics system. The classification was done using the texture features of the leaves derived from machine vision algorithms. The attributes underwent three different feature selection processes, namely: Univariate Selection (US), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Feature Importance (FI) to determine the four most significant features from the original eight attributes. The features selected were used for training four estimators from Decision Trees Classifier (DTC), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models trained using DTC and SGD were then optimized as they have hyperparameters for tuning. A comparative analysis among Machine Learning (ML) algorithms was conducted to identify the best-performing model with the given application. The best features were derived from US and FI as they have the same top four features using the DTC estimator optimized with the hyperparameters tuned to max depth having 5, criterion equated to ‘Gini', and splitter was set to 'Best'. The accuracy obtained from cross-validation evaluation resulted in 87.92\%. Considering consistency with hold-out validation, LDA outperforms optimized DTC even with lower accuracy of 86.67\%. This accuracy of LDA outperformed DTC due to its sufficient fit for generalizing the testing data on classifying lettuce growth stage.},

  abstract = {Electrical energy is the highest energetic cost in recirculation aquaponic systems (RASs), especially for fish-tank water. Therefore, reducing energy consumption is one of the challenges in developing RAS models. In this study, eleven experimental setups, based on numerical models from an earlier investigator, were built to investigate. Among them, three additional cases (cases 9–11) investigated the transient discharging energy efficiency of thermal energy storage (TES). Cases 9–11 considered three temperature levels, namely, 65–75 ◦C, 71–81 ◦C, and 81–87 ◦C, with a mass flow rate of 0.166 kg/s. The results show that when heating 3.4 m3 of fish tank water from 24.5 ◦C to 28 ◦C, the average temperature error of the tank water was between 1.2\% and 3.4\%. The difference in the heat transfer rate was within ±4.2\%. The error in the thermal efficiency was below 8.0\%. The error range of the total required thermal energy was from 6.4\% to 11.5\%. Cases 9–11 used 5.6\%, 6.4\%, and 7.2\% of the thermal energy of the TES tank, respectively. The electrical energy consumption was low compared to the thermal energy of the fish tank water received from the TES unit. Therefore, the proposed low-energy-consumption heating method can replace electric heaters.},

  abstract = {Abstract.                              Control of indoor temperature and humidity is of critical concern for controlled environment agriculture systems in hot, arid regions. Evaporative cooling is a technology utilized for energy-efficient cooling and humidification of these systems. However, the evaporative cooling process consumes considerable amounts of water, as much as 80-90\% of the water footprint for indoor food production in these regions. The use of saline water in place of fresh water in evaporative cooling systems offers a potential solution for greatly improving the sustainability of these systems. However, the use of saline water in industry-standard cellulose pad systems can cause premature clogging of the porous medium, leading to system failure and the need for porous media replacement. A new evaporative cooling technology consisting of crushed pozzolan volcanic rock formed into porous bricks was evaluated for use in controlled environment agriculture systems using saline water. Two brick designs were tested for proof of concept cooling of commercial-scale greenhouses. Temperature-based cooling efficiencies of the bricks were achieved that are comparable to cellulose pads. In addition, the pozzolan-based bricks showed impressive resistance to saline water and harsh environments, requiring no replacement over the duration of the experimental trials. The integration of the pozzolan evaporative cooling systems using sea or brackish water with a water-saving growing technology, such as recirculating aquaponics or hydroponics, shows promise for reducing the fresh water footprint of food raised indoors in hot, dry environments by as much as 80\%-90\%.

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a technology that is part of the broader integrated agriaquaculture systems discipline which seeks to combine animal and plant culture technologies to confer advantages and conserve nutrients and other biological and economic resources. It emerged in the USA in the early 1970s and has recently seen a resurgence, especially in Europe. Whilst aquaponics broadly combines recirculating fish culture with hydroponic plant production, the application of the term aquaponic is broad and many technologies claim use of the name. Combining fish culture with aquatic-based, terrestrial plant culture via aquaponics may be better defined via its nutrient resource sharing credentials. Aquaponics applies several principles including, but not limited to, efficient water use, efficient nutrient use, lowered or negated environmental impact and the application of biological and ecological approaches to agricultural fish and plant production. Water sources are important so that the nutrients required for fish and plant production are available and balanced, and system water chemistry is paramount to optimised fish and plant production. Systems may be configured in several ways, including those that are fully recirculating and those that are decoupled. Aquaponics importantly seeks to apply methods that provide technical, biological, chemical, environmental and economic advantages.},

The results demonstrated that the aquaponic method performed well, and, in many cases, the growth rates produced were similar to those of the hydroponic method. Lettuce growth was compared across three seasons (summer, winter, and spring), and, in all cases, the aquaponically-grown lettuce equalled, or bettered, the hydroponic equivalent. Herb growth was compared over a five-month period (February to June—summer/autumn), and in 17 out of 23 comparisons, the aquaponic method produced results similar to those of the hydroponic method. Thus, while the NFT method may not be the most appropriate technical approach for aquaponic integration, the results suggest that the overall aquaponic method has the potential to produce plant growth rates at least equal to those of standard hydroponics.},

  abstract = {Murray Cod, Maccullochella peelii peelii (Mitchell), and Green Oak lettuce, Lactuca sativa, were used to test for differences between three hydroponic subsystems, Gravel Bed, Floating Raft and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), in a freshwater Aquaponic test system, where plant nutrients were supplied from fish wastes while plants stripped nutrients from the waste water before it was returned to the fish. The Murray Cod had FCR’s and biomass gains that were statistically identical in all systems. Lettuce yields were good, and in terms of biomass gain and yield, followed the relationship Gravel bed {$>$} Floating {$>$} NFT, with significant differences seen between all treatments. The NFT treatment was significantly less efficient than the other two treatments in terms of nitrate removal (20\% less efficient), whilst no significant difference was seen between any test treatments in terms of phosphate removal. In terms of dissolved oxygen, water replacement and conductivity, no significant differences were observed between any test treatments. Overall, results suggest that NFT hydroponic sub-systems are less efficient at both removing nutrients from fish culture water and producing plant biomass or yield than Gravel bed or Floating hydroponic sub-systems in an Aquaponic context. Aquaponic system designers need to take these differences into account when designing hydroponic components within aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {A literature search was performed via SCOPUS for publications between January 2000 and April 2020 that contained the keywords aquaponic and hydroponic. Sixty-one articles were identified that stated a comparison and a form of comparative statistical analysis was performed. These articles were identified via the principle author, year of publication, the system type tested (coupled or decoupled aquaponic; irrigated nutrient solution from a separated RAS), the number of treatments tested, the number of replicates applied to each treatment and the region or country within which the experiment was performed. An experimental comparison context was assigned to each study to identify the requirement for replication. Sixty-one percent (61 \%) of all the studies were deemed to have applied no or incorrect replication (no or incorrect replication: 56 \% of fully recirculating system studies, 100 \% of decoupled system studies, 86 \% of irrigated RAS water studies). In terms of the comparison context, 54 \% of system comparison studies, 100 \% of solution comparison studies and 63 \% of plant component associated comparison studies, applied no or incorrect replication. The association between study location and the incidence of no or incorrect replication was also determined (Europe – 71 \%, USA – 80 \%, South America – 63 \%, Australia – 33 \%, West Asia – 5 \%, South East Asia; including China – 20 \% and South Asia – 14 \%). An experimental replication decision matrix was developed to assist future aquaponic researchers in determining the application of correct replication and several example research articles were discussed to demonstrate and explain the correct and incorrect application of replication in experimental designs for aquaponic associated research studies.},

  abstract = {In a recirculating aquaponic system (RAS), the heating method based on an electric heater requires considerable amounts of electrical energy to maintain the water temperature for optimal warm-water fish growth conditions. Minimizing electrical energy consumption in the RAS is a great challenge. To solve this problem, a novel heating method that uses a combination of helically coiled heat exchangers (HCHEs) and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit is proposed to replace the electric heater. Several studies on heating and cooling systems with HCHEs and TES tanks have been conducted, but their integration in RASs is very rare. In this study, the thermal energy of the water in an RAS was the research objective. A computational fluid dynamics approach was adopted for transient analysis and inspection of the HCHE model considering eight cases with four temperature levels, 55, 60, 70, and 80 °C, and three mass flow rates, 0.166, 0.249, and 0.332 kg/s. The results showed that the HCHE was compatible with the regular heat sources of the TES unit (including solar collectors and heat pump systems). The temperature distribution of the water in the fish tank, from 26.75 to 30 °C, was suitable for maintaining the health of warm-water fish. To heat 3.4 m3 of the fish tank water from 24.5 to 28 °C, case 6 (where the temperature and mass flow rate of hot water were 70 °C and 0.332 kg/s, respectively) obtained the best results during a period of 26 min, usable heat transfer rate of 31.8 kW, and thermal efficiency of 76.1\%. On the contrary, the results for case 1 (where the temperature and mass flow rate of hot water were 60 °C and 0.166 kg/ s, respectively) were 70 min, 11.8 kW, and 57.5\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {This study assessed the common chicory performance in aquaponics and soil fertilized with aquaponics sludge. The experimental setup consisted of an aquaponic system for farming tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and culti­ vating common chicory (Cichorium intybus), with two interdependent cultivation lines. The aquaponics component consisted of two treatments with six repetitions, comparing the two cultivation methods of (1) floating rafts and (2) substrate. The soil production of the plants consisted of three treatments with three rep­ etitions: (1) fertilization with aquaponic sludge; (2) chemical fertilization (NPK); and (3) control (without fertilization). The sludge (80 L) was collected twice weekly from the bottom of two clarifiers, homogenized, and later applied to the soil. The results of the productive performance and the composition of the plant tissue were evaluated, comparing phyto-technical parameters (NL: number of leaves; LLL: longer leaf length; FM: fresh matter; and DM: Dry matter) of each plant between treatments in the soil and between treatments in aquaponics, and a comparison between cycles for each treatment. Higher yields (g plant− 1) were obtained in the aquaponics system with the floating method when compared to the substrate method for the common chicory in the first cycle. In the second cycle, there was a higher yield of vegetables with the substrate method perhaps due to the accumulation of organic matter in the substrate. The vegetables grown in the floating method accumulated higher concentrations of N, P and K in the leaf tissues in both cycles. The production of common chicory in the soil during the first cycle showed no differences between the Sludge and NPK treatments, and both were superior to the Control for all phyto-technical parameters. Differences were shown for the LLL, FM and DM for the second cycle, with higher values shown for plants fertilized with sludge when compared to those treated with NPK or in the Control. These results suggest a cumulative effect of nutrients in the soil after successive sludge applications combined with the mineralization of nutrients, making them available in soil solution. Higher P concentrations in the leaf tissue of the common chicory in the treatment with sludge fertilization suggests higher absorption rates of this element. The aquaponic sludge can be used to fertilize vegetables in the soil and obtain yields similar to and possibly higher than those of mineral fertilization.},

Two aquaponic (well water (WW) and diluted seawater (DSW)) treatments and one hydroponic control (hydroponic solution (HS)) were examined. The trend of Hg accumulated in basil tissues was roots {$>$} leaves {$>$} stems. No significant differences (p {$>$} 0.05) were found between aquaponic treatments. Mercury concentrations in the edible basil tissues were below the maximum allowable levels (0.2 mg kg− 1) for vegetables established by international guidelines (WHO, 2007; CREU, 2018). The mass balances evidenced that most Hg ({$>$} 99\%) entered the aquaponic system through the input water, while the main output route ({$>$} 90\%) was through the zeolite used in plants. Mercury inorganic speciation in water was similar between WW and DSW treatments. The dominating speciation was HgCl2 (50\%), which is a bioavailable form that biota can use. In the HS treatment, the chemical speciation was different as it formed complexes mainly with ammonia. The health risk index for Hg was {$<$} 1.0, which indicates that the population exposed to the consumption of basil grown with shrimp would not be at risk.},

  abstract = {The aquaponic system can satisfy the different needs of aquatic products and plants by utilizing nutrient flow to improve the economic benefit. Nitrogen is a key nutrient element in such process. High nitrogen concentration can worsen water quality, which may further result in mass death of typical fish and/or shellfish. Therefore, it is particularly important to monitor the nitrogen concentration to manage aquatic products and plants growth in aquaponic systems. Sensors for measuring nitrogen concentration are commercially available, but they are often expensive and unreliable in service. At the same time, the research on the soft sensor of nitrogen concentration is very limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a new adaptive filtering-based soft sensor method for real-time estimation of total nitrogen concentration. This method provides accurate prediction by integrating mecha­ nistic model, online measurements (e.g. fish biomass, temperature) and infrequent offline measurement of total nitrogen. A moving-horizon estimation (MHE) algorithm is used for joint state and parameter estimation, thus allowing correction of mismatch between model parameters and the real process. Furthermore, the appropriate frequency of offline nitrogen measurement is determined to balance between the soft sensor accuracy and cost. Through computer simulation study of an aquaponic system, the proposed approach is effective to provide promising real-time prediction performance. By applying the correction method, the RMSE (root-mean-square error) of nitrogen concentration estimation is reduced by 31.86\% on average compared to the simulated practical situation. In conclusion, the proposed soft sensor method could provide useful monitoring of the total nitrogen in aquaponics, and such information could be used for optimizing the operations.},

  abstract = {Continuous Innovation (CI) has become one of the hot topics in innovation management field. However, studies focusing on the comprehensive and detailed explanation of CI concept are still limited. This paper aims to elaborate on CI concept using three fundamental questions: WHAT (what is the definition of CI and what are the determining factors?), WHY (why do companies need CI?), and HOW (how can companies develop CI?). The purpose of this paper is also to contribute in giving an understanding that is more exhaustive on CI definition, the importance of CI for companies, necessary elements in determining CI capability, and various strategies for CI development. From this literature study, a new and more comprehensive definition of CI was found, which categorized the reason why the companies need the CI and identified essential elements in determining CI capability. In addition, the mapping process produced a description of the proportion of CI development strategy as follows: technology-based (11\%), People based (15\%), organizational \& system based (32\%), strategic-based (11\%), knowledge-based (22\%) and collaborative \& connectivity based (9\%). It can be observed that current CI development strategies still focus on organizational, system based approach, and most of them (81\%) rely on the internal resources of the company. Future perspectives, in this digital and internet era, which provides connectivity and the shift of the concept of, own economy to sharing economy; companies will have big potentials to work on innovation collaboratively. CI concept development should consider open innovations instead of today’s “do-it-yourself” mentality (closed innovation).},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the integration of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponic systems which is considered to be an innovative, eco-friendly and sustainable food production technology. In this study, a special design of hydroponic biofilter that integrated constructed wetlands and floating-raft rice hydroponics was constructed to treat the nutrient rich effluents from the intensive fishpond and to establish an aquaponic system on pond scale. The treatment efficiencies and food production potential of the new rice hydroponic biofilter was evaluated after determining the key operating parameters. As the results, overall nutrient removal efficiency was optimized at hydraulic load rate (HLR) of 0.58 m.d−1 and air-to-water ratio of 2:1. The average removal efficiencies of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) from fishpond wastewater were in the range of 33.75–34.31\%, 59.21–64.53\%, 68.43–73.75\% and 71.66–74.37\%, respectively. Meanwhile, hydroponic rice grew well in the biofilter and gained a yield of 7 127 kg.ha−1. These results probably implied that the novel rice hydroponic biofilter exhibited efficient effluent treatment and presented as a viable alternative for the food production in a pond-scale aquaponics recirculating system.},

In order to quantify the nutrients content of sprouts grown under different conditions, we conducted a factorial experiment with 3 types of growth conditions, routine cultivation (RC), circulating water supplement cultivation (CWSC) and aquaponic system cultivation (ASC), then produce sprouts (soybean sprouts, mung bean sprouts, pea sprouts and radish sprouts) under these conditions. The results showed that each sprout under ASC condition, height, weight (10 sprouts), vitamin C content, protein content and soluble sugar content were significantly higher than those under RC condition and CWSC condition. Each sprout showed significant difference in height, weight (10 sprouts), vitamin C content and soluble sugar content. The presence of Carassius auratus auratus can significantly promote the growth of sprouts in aquaponic system, and increase nutrients content. Therefore, aquaponic system can be promoted vigorously in urban areas.},

  abstract = {The growing aquaculture industry raises concern about  environmental impacts. Recirculating aquaculture sys­ tems (RAS) have been developed to respond to increas­ ing environmental regulations in countries with limi­ ted access to land and water. By combining RAS with  hydroponic systems, where plants for human consump­ tion grow in the nutrient rich recirculating water, seve­ ral advantages related to energy conservation, water and  nutrient reuse can be obtained. Aquaponic systems vary  in size from small units to large commercial units. The  systems may hold fresh water fish species with produc­ tion of herbs, vegetables or fruits, or salt water species  with focus on algae production. So far, most experience  has been gained by using robust warm water fish species,  such as tilapia. By introducing cold water species like  trout or salmon in aquaponics, several challenges and  new requirements have to be resolved. In a project partly  funded by the Regional Research Fund of Agder and  Innovation Norway, a pilot scale aquaponic system has  been established at Evje in Aust-Agder county, Norway.  The goal of this project is to provide an economic and  practical analysis for cold water aquaponics, providing  technological solutions and business models.  Introduction Over the last two decades, the production of fry and smolt  at Norwegian hatcheries has been more than doubled,  and this trend is also expected through the next decade  (Figure 1). In order to increase the production capacity,  Norwegian smolt farmers must address more intensive  types of water treatment technologies, such as recircu­ lating aquaculture systems (RAS) including advanced  water treatment to maintain optimum rearing condition.  The environmental impact of the aquaculture indus­ try is scrutinized and raises growing environmental con­ cerns. It becomes increasingly clear that the long term  sustainability of many aquaculture operations in Nor­ way, as well as in other countries, is dependent on the  ability to minimize and mitigate negative environmental  impacts. It has been calculated that the production of one  ton of rainbow trout produce in total 50 kg N and 9 kg  P as waste (Bergheim \& Åsgård 1996, Azevedo et al.  2011).  RAS have been developed to respond to the increas­ing environmental regulations in countries with limited  access to land and water, and provides distinct advantages  over pond and cage-based forms of aquaculture. RAS are  often promoted as a way to reduce the volume of waste  discharge to the environment, yet the disposal of accumulated waste is always a major concern. Due to efficient  treatment in the recirculating loop, and reduced effluent  water flow, pollution from RAS to the external environ­ ment is much easier to control. In 2009/2010, a total of  214 smolt farms were in operation in Norway. Only some  10\% out of these farms have been converted to RAS. The  expected number of new intensively run RAS farms are some 6-8 per year (Drengstig et al. 2011). Greenhouse production and other forms of horticulture in controlled or semi-controlled environments are important industries in Norwegian and European coun­tries. The use of hydroponic systems, where the plants are growing in recirculating water enriched with nutri­ents, are common in greenhouses. Such systems create a controlled environment for growing plants. By com­bining aquaculture and hydroponic systems, several ad­vantages related to energy conservation, water and nutri­ent reuse can be obtained.},

The experiment was conducted at the Aquaculture Station of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Brazil, during 128 days. Fish 123.0 ± 0.6 g were stocked in twelve 800 L circular tanks in a completely randomized design with three treatments (D15, D30 and D45, related to densities of 15, 30 and 45 fish.m-3) and four replicates. Among water quality variables, dissolved oxygen had a significant effect (P≤0.05) between the densities, with the lowest concentration (3.97 mg O2.L-1) for the highest tested density (45 fish.m-3). The total ammonia present statistical difference between the D15 and the others; and also, the nitrite, between density 15 and 45 fish.m-3, but both at a directly proportional relationship with the increasing of stocking density, showing higher average concentrations of 2.56 and 3.26 mg.L-1 (NH3+NH4 and NO2, respectively), in 45 density fish.m-3. The growth performance in the 45 fish.m-3 density showed the best results, with yield of 16.6 kg.m-3, with significant difference between treatments (P≤0.05). Survival was higher than 90\% at the three tested densities. Bioflocs technology can be employed in intensive culture of Nile tilapia O. niloticus in the growout phase, using stocking densities up to 45 fish.m-3.},

The UASB reactor is developed in the late  1970s and became rapidly widespread due to great performances. With granules, this reactor is able to treat  various high-strength industrial wastewaters and most soluble wastewater could be applied in this reactor. The  EGSB reactor was also developed to give more chances to contact between wastewater and granules. Besides,  this reactor is able to separate dispersed sludge from mature granule using rapid upward velocity. Then, it is  possible  to  treat  high-strength  and  low-strength  wastewater  such  as  domestic  wastewater,  especially  low  temperature. The SGBR is innovated at IOWA state University and good performances have been reported for  various  wastewaters  similar  to  the  UASB  and  the  EGSB  reactor.  This  reactor  is  downflow  unlike  other  reactors. And, it is very simple so that additional parts are not needed for this process. Sludge granulation  process  is  not  clearly  understood  yet,  but  EPS  is  very  important  a  role  to  make  a  granule.  Moreover,  its  structure and granulation process have been researched continuously.},

  abstract = {Malnutrition in all forms, ranging from undernourishment to obesity and associated diet-related diseases, is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, while food systems often have major environmental impacts. Rapid global population growth and increases in demands for food and changes in dietary habits create challenges to provide universal access to healthy food without creating negative environmental, economic, and social impacts. This article discusses opportunities for and challenges to sustainable food systems from a human health perspective by making the case for avoiding the transition to unhealthy less sustainable diets (using India as an exemplar), reducing food waste by changing consumer behaviour (with examples from Japan), and using innovations and new technologies to reduce the environmental impact of healthy food production. The article touches upon two of the challenges to achieving healthy sustainable diets for a global population, i.e., reduction on the yield and nutritional quality of crops (in particular vegetables and fruits) due to climate change; and trade-offs between food production and industrial crops. There is an urgent need to develop and implement policies and practices that provide universal access to healthy food choices for a growing world population, whilst reducing the environmental footprint of the global food system.},

  abstract = {According to the “World Population Prospects 2022” released by the United Nations in August 2022, the world will officially enter an “aging society”. In order to provide the elderly with an improved quality of daily life, “health promotion” and “prevention of disease” will be important. With respect to care of the elderly, the concepts of “therapeutic environment” and “green care” have been explored and developed. Therefore, in this study, we combine the currently popular Internet of Things (IoT) into an aquaponics system and proposes a smart green care system (SGCS). The proposed system uses face recognition technology to record the labor and rehabilitation history of the elderly, in combination with environmental data analysis, to enable automatic control decisions for equipment in conjunction with a voice control system to reduce the obstacles faced by the elderly in operating the information system. It also uses image recognition technology to monitor and notify about plant diseases and insect pests to achieve automatic management and enhance the interaction between the elderly and the SGCS through human–computer interaction. The SGCS allows the elderly to guide it to participate in appropriate activities through direct contact with the natural environment, thereby enhancing the quality of green healing life. In this study, taking long-term care institutions as an example, we verified proof of concept (PoC), proof of service (PoS), and proof of business (PoB), confirming the feasibility of the SGCS. The SGCS proposed in this study can be successfully used in long-term care institutions and various other environments, such as medical units and home care contexts. It can take full advantage of the functions associated with the concept of “healing environment” and “green care” widely recognized by users. Therefore, it can be widely used in the field of long-term care in the future.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is considered as a promising approach to mass produce both fish meat and vegetable at high rates without discharge pollutants. A novel aquaponics system is proposed to control water quality and enhance nutrition efficiency with high rate immobilized biofilm units, including mass-bio system (MBS) and fiber biofilter (FB), installed between upstream hydroponics units, which are composed of the media filled beds (MFD) and nutrient film technique (NFT), and downstream aquaculture unit for fish rearing. A pilot test was conducted over 130 d to characterize the performance of proposed system which converted residual nutrients from aquaculture unit into ammonium and nitrate at balanced ratio for aquatic plant growth and then removed residual ammonium or/and nitrite to ensue recycled water quality for fish rearing. The kinetics of organic matter removal and nutrient conversion in hydroponics unit and immobilized biofilm units were determined via batch assays over 24 h in the system. The estimated daily pollutant increments for TAN, NOÀ2 -N, NOÀ3 -N, TN, DTP and TOC in the system were 0.28, 0.17, 0.20, 0.64, 0.56 and 2.19 mg/L, respectively. The results demonstrated that total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite (NOÀ2 -N), nitrate (NOÀ3 -N), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved total phosphorus (DTP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were maintained at low levels in the system for a long-term. Aquatic plants in MFD and NFT contributed to the removal of TAN, NOÀ2 -N, NOÀ3 -N, TN and DTP. The removal efficiencies of MFD versus NFT for TAN were 71.4\% vs 43.5\% for TAN and 62.5\% vs 52.3\% for DTP. MBS and FB performed the removal of TAN, NO2À-N and TOC. The 24 h removal efficiencies of TAN, NO2À-N and TOC were 71.8\%, 58.5\% and 3.7\% for MBS and 15.7\%, 7.7\% and 27.2\% for FB.},

The effects of autotrophs, floating beds of water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) and microalgae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) on water purification and shrimp growth were assessed. The results showed that the water quality of aquaculture water with water spinach (S1), aquaculture water with chlorella (S2), and aquaculture water with water spinach and chlorella (S3) were significantly better than that of Aquaculture water without vegetation and chlorella (S0). The combination of water spinach and chlorella (S3) was able to keep ammonia and nitrite nitrogen levels below 1.0 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L, respectively. These low levels were not lethal or detrimental to the growth of the white shrimp. The roots of the water spinach were the vital organs for the removal of N and P. Sixty percent of the removed portion of N and P accumulated in the roots of the water spinach. The survival rate and mean harvest weight of shrimp from S1, and S3 was significantly higher than that from S0, and S2. In addition, in S3 the immunity of the shrimp was improved due to the formation of similar biological floccules around the roots and thus increasing their survival rate. The present study indicates that a vegetable-microalgae-shrimp system has a good potential for practical application in commercial shrimp production.},

  abstract = {The goal of this project, one of the proposals of the EPS@ISEP 2014 Spring, was to develop an Aquaponics System. Over recent years Aquaponics systems have received increased attention due to its possibilities in helping reduce strain on resources within 1st and 3rd world countries. Aquaponics is the combination of Hydroponics and Aquaculture and mimics a natural environment in order to successfully apply and enhance the understanding of natural cycles within an indoor process. By using this knowledge of natural cycles it was possible to create a system with the capabilities similar to that of a natural environment with the benefits of electronic adaptions to enhance the overall efficiency of the system. The multinational team involved in its development was composed of five students, from five countries and fields of study. This paper covers their solution, involving overall design, the technology involved and the benefits it could bring to the current market. The team was able to achieve the final rendered Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings, successfully performed all the electronic testing, and designed a solution under budget. Furthermore, the solution presented was deeply studied from the sustainability viewpoint and the team also developed a product specific marketing plan. Finally, the students involved in this project obtained new knowledge and skills.},

  abstract = {Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is an important vegetable in the country which is consumed both raw and as processed product. This study aimed to evaluate the growth, yield, postharvest qualities and profitability of aquaponically grown tomato supplemented with different nutrient solutions. The study was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design with 8 treatments replicated 3 times. Tomato fruits were first harvested 60 days after transplanting with 100 percent survival rate. Early flowering of tomato plant was observed when applied with VSU liquid nutrient formulation (VSU-LNF) with node number ranging from 13.33-14.00 bearing the first flower. Growth parameters such as plant height, number of lateral shoot, root length and fruit size are stimulated by the application of VSU liquid nutrient formulation and in combination with ferments. This also resulted to high number and weight of marketable fruit in tomato plant. Carotenoid and chlorophyll contents of the fruits were higher in aquaponically grown tomato supplemented with fermented kuhol (Pomacea canaliculata L.). Free radical scavenging activity was found highest in the fruit of tomato grown in aquaponic system supplemented with combined VSU liquid nutrient formulation with fermented malunggay (Moringa olifera). However, vitamin Cand sugar content of tomato fruits were found highest when supplemented with combine VSU liquid nutrient formulation and fermented kuhol. No significant differences were obtained on firmness, percent weight loss, respiration rate at 2 and 4 weeks after storage, titratable acidity, fruit nitrogen, pH of fruit, oxidation reduction potential, electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids. On the other hand, higher moisture content of the tomato fruits were observed with the application of VSU liquid nutrient formulation and in combination with ferments. Therefore, high yield was produced with the application of VSU liquid nutrient formulation which resulted to higher net return. Aquaponically grown tomato supplemented with VSU-LNF produced lesser yield but with considerable net return.},

  abstract = {The role of the microbial community in mediating fish and plant co-culture is often considered the black box of aquaponics. Despite widespread recognition regarding the dependency of plants on their rhizosphere, the extent to which upstream aquaculture influences downstream hydroponic root communities has been poorly described in the literature. In this study we performed a taxonomic survey (16S rRNA metabarcoding) of microbial communities originating in the facility water source, hydroponic nutrient solution (HNS) sump, nutrient supplemented biofilter effluent (BF) sump, and recirculating aquaculture system tanks stocked with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) was then grown using the HNS and BF effluent under sterilized or mature (prior aquaponics/hydroponics lettuce culture water) conditions, likewise, the influence of probiotic addition or inoculation with soil-grown lettuce rhizosphere was assessed. Compositional similarities across treatments suggest that under soil-less conditions, plants are able to exert a stronger discriminatory influence on their rhizosphere composition than is done by colonization from upstream sources. Furthermore, cluster dendrograms grouped the sterilized and unsterilized treatments more consistently together than hydroponics and aquaponics treatments. These findings contradict conventional beliefs that microbial communities in the water column colonize roots based on their presence alone, ignoring the role that plants play in rhizosphere community selection.},

However, there are uncertainties and little information about the economic sustainability of small-scale self-managed aquaponic systems. The objective of this study was to obtain economic information about these systems, including the level of commoditization of food production as a measure of their autonomy. For this purpose, two small-scale aquaponic systems (SAS) based on FAO models were self-constructed using cheap and easy-to-obtain materials and monitored for a year. A total of 62 kg of tilapia and 352 kg of 22 different vegetables and fruits were produced, with an average net agricultural added value of 151.3 €. Results showed positive accounting profit but negative economic profit when labor costs were included. The degree of commoditization was around 44\%, which allows a certain autonomy, thanks to the use of family labor force.},

Mineral fertilisers, especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are used to supply the living organisms with nutrients, and for growing of fungi, carbon must be applied from sugar or starch products. This input-for-output approach does not contribute to cycling of nutrients and organic matter in the society. Organic*1 agriculture has a strong interest in recycled fertilisers and best utilisation of organic materials, and appliccable products should be developed not only for use in agricultural fields but also for other purposes, such as hydroponics, aquaponics and bioreactors. Animal bones and precipitated struvite from waste water are examples of materials which may be applicable in bioreactors. Containing easily available N and P, recent studies have shown that these materials are valuable for amendment of soil fertility and crop productivity in land-based agriculture. Studies should be initiated to design bioreactors utilising locally available sources of nutrients and organic matter, to make the bioreactors more sustainable and develop organic* farming systems in a context of landless farming.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics. There is expanding interest in aquaponics as a form of aquaculture that can be used to produce food closer to urban centers. Commercial aquaponics uses methods and equipment from both the hydroponics and aquaculture industries. There have been few studies of commercial-scale aquaponics production, and the purpose of this research was to document the production methods, crop and fish yields, and profitability of commercial aquaponics in the United States (US) and internationally. An online survey was used for data collection, and 257 respondents met the inclusion criteria for the study. Eighty-one percent of respondents lived in the US, and the remaining respondents were from 22 other countries. The median year that respondents had begun practicing aquaponics was 2010. A total of 538 fulltime workers, 242 part-time workers, and 1720 unpaid workers or volunteers were employed at surveyed organizations. The most commonly raised aquatic animals by percent were tilapia (69\%), ornamental fish (43\%), catfish (25\%), other aquatic animals (18\%), perch (16\%), bluegill (15\%), trout (10\%), and bass (7\%). Production statistics, gross sales revenue, investments, and sales outlets for operations are reported and compared to other fields of aquaculture and agriculture. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to study which factors were associated with profitability (as a binary outcome) in the past 12 months. Several factors were significantly associated with profitability: aquaponics as the respondents' primary source of income (p b 0.01; Odds Ratio: 5.79; 95\% Confidence Interval: 3.8–9.0), location in US Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 7–13 (p b 0.01; OR: 4.17; 95\% CI: 3.2–5.5), gross sales revenue ≥\$5000 (p b 0.01; OR: 3.58; 95\% CI: 2.2–5.8), greater aquaponics knowledge (p b 0.01; OR: 2.37; 95\% CI: 2.0–2.9), and sales of non-food products (e.g., supplies, materials, consulting services, workshops, and agrotourism) (p = 0.028; OR: 2.13; 95\% CI: 1.1–4.2).

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a form of aquaculture that integrates hydroponics to raise edible plants and fish. There is growing interest in aquaponics because it can be practiced in non-traditional locations for agriculture such as inside warehouses and on marginal lands, and it can provide locally grown products without using synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or antibiotics. Yet questions remain about the ecological and economic sustainability of aquaponics. The objective of this study was to describe the operating conditions, inputs (energy, water, and fish feed) and outputs (edible crops and fish) and their relationship over two years for a small-scale raft aquaponics operation in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The system had roughly 1\% water loss per day and used an average of 35,950 L for replenishment per year. Predicted values suggest rainfall could completely replace the existing water needs. The average energy use was 19,526 kWh for propane and electricity per year at a cost of \$2055 US dollars. The largest uses of electricity were in-tank water heaters. Comparing inputs to outputs, 104 L of water, 0.5 kg feed, and 56 kWh energy (\$6 in energy costs) were needed to produce 1 kg of crops; and 292 L of water, 1.3 kg feed, and 159 kWh of energy (\$12 in energy costs) were needed to produce a 1 kg increase in tilapia. Raising tilapia was a net loss, while raising crops was a net gain when comparing market prices to energy costs. Understanding energy, water, and feed use in aquaponic systems is essential to inform farm business plans. These data can serve as a point of comparison to other small-scale aquaponic systems, and inform future work on life cycle assessments of aquaponics.},

The aim of this study was to document and analyze the production methods, experiences, motivations, and demographics of aquaponics practitioners in the United States (US) and internationally. The survey was distributed online using a chain sampling method that relied on referrals from initial respondents, with 809 respondents meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority of respondents were from the US (80\%), male (78\%), and had at least a high school degree (91\%). The mean age of respondents was 47613 years old. Most respondents (52\%) had three years or less of aquaponics experience. Respondents typically raised tilapia or ornamental fish and a variety of leafy green vegetables, herbs, and fruiting crops. Respondents were most often motivated to become involved in aquaponics to grow their own food, for environmental sustainability reasons, and for personal health reasons. Many respondents employed more than one method to raise crops, and used alternative or environmentally sustainable sources of energy, water, and fish feed. In general, our findings suggest that aquaponics is a dynamic and rapidly growing field with participants who are actively experimenting with and adopting new technologies. Additional research and outreach is needed to evaluate and communicate best practices within the field. This survey is the first large-scale effort to track aquaponics in the US and provides information that can better inform policy, research, and education efforts regarding aquaponics as it matures and possibly evolves into a mainstream form of agriculture.},

In addition to providing computer-assisted aid to complex issues surrounding water chemistry and physical/biological processes, artificial intelligence and machine-learning (AI/ML) applications are anticipated to further optimize water-based applications and decrease capital expenses. This review offers a cross-section of peer reviewed, critical water-based applications that have been coupled with AI or ML, including chlorination, adsorption, membrane filtration, water-quality-index monitoring, water-quality-parameter modeling, river-level monitoring, and aquaponics/hydroponics automation/monitoring. Although success in control, optimization, and modeling has been achieved with the AI methods, ML models, and smart technologies (including the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and systems based on these technologies) that are reviewed herein, key challenges and limitations were common and pervasive throughout. Poor data management, low explainability, poor model reproducibility and standardization, as well as a lack of academic transparency are all important hurdles to overcome in order to successfully implement these intelligent applications. Recommendations to aid explainability, data management, reproducibility, and model causality are offered in order to overcome these hurdles and continue the successful implementation of these powerful tools.},

The timeframes of this study are the period of the Poland’s membership in  the European Union, i.e. 2004-2016. The analysis was based on IFOAM data and  Polish organic agriculture reports published biannually by the General Agricultural  and Food Quality Inspection (GIJHARS). This paper notes that the 2004-2016~pe - riod witnessed a quantitative growth of organic farming, as reflected by a dynamic  increase in the area of organic farmland and in the number of farms. In the last  three years, a decline in the area of organic agricultural land has been recorded  due to changes in the conditions of environmental payments. In 2014-2015, a large  part of farms discontinued their organic farming activities due to lack of production  activities and market links. In Poland, despite a highly dynamic increase in organic  farmland area and in the number of farms, the organic production and processing  volumes continue to be low.},

  abstract = {Modern aquaculture recirculation systems (RASs) are a necessary tool to provide sustainable and continuous aquaculture production with low environmental impact. But, productivity and efficiency of such RAS still have to be optimized to ensure economic viability, putting growth performance into the focus. Growth is often reported as absolute (gain per day), relative (percentage increase in size) or specific growth rate (percentage increase in size per day), based on stocking and harvesting data. These functions describe growth very simplified and are inaccurate because intermediate growth data are not considered. In contrast, nonlinear growth models attempt to provide information of growth across different life stages. On the basis of an empirical RAS data set of 150 all-female turbot reared in an RAS during a period of 340 days of outgrowth, this paper reviews the most commonly used growth rates (relative, absolute, specific), the thermal-unit growth coefficient and five nonlinear growth functions (logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy, Kanis and Schnute). Goodness of fit is expressed by R2 and as mean percentage deviation. Nonlinear growth models are also compared by their residual standard error (RSE) and the Akaike information criterion. All processed functions are modelled to illustrate the shape of the generated curve and the possibility of the function to realistically predict growth. Further, the biological meaning of their regression parameters is discussed. This way we can point out differences in nonlinear growth models in contrast to purely descriptive growth rates and the specific advantages, disadvantages and possible applications of each function we review.},

  abstract = {Catfish cultivation has been carried out in Indonesia. One such development is the maintenance of catfish using an aquaponic system. Aquaponics aims to improve the water quality of fish farming with the help of plants. But plants cannot directly utilize fish farming waste directly, it is necessary to have a nitrification process first. Nitrification is the reformation of inorganic compounds into organic compounds with the help of bacteria. Nitrifying bacteria are colonized and non-motile bacteria, so a substrate is needed as a place to attach to the bacteria. The substrate that can be used is bioball and bioring. This study aims to determine whether the effect and filter media are effective in catfish farming with an aquaponic system. This study using the RAL method consisting of 4 treatments and 5 replications, namely P0 = control, P1 = bioball, P2 = bioring and P3 = bioball and bioring combinations. The results obtained that P3 (bioball and bioring combination) is the most effective treatment in reducing the nitrogenous waste catfish aquaculture using an aquaponics system, the results is 0,000 mg / L ammonium, nitrite 0.001 mg / L and nitrate 13.0 mg / L at the end of the study.},

  abstract = {The present research attempted to address a key industry-level question amidst Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) waste throughput and aquaponics limitations controversies. Nutrient throughput of three operational RAS farms with progressive size proportions (16, 130, 1400 m3), aquaculture intensity (24, 62, 86 kg stock m−3) were studied. Results suggest - daily total efflux and potency of nutrients in effluents should not be generalized, extreme variability exists. Consistencies of nutrients in wastewater (except N, Ca and Na) are higher than in sludge. Asynchrony between patterns of nutrient loading and effluent nutrient concentrations exist for secondary macronutrients and micronutrients (S, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, B, Mo). Macronutrient output generally increases with increasing farm size and culture intensity but same cannot be said for micronutrients. Deficiency in wastewater can be completely masked using raw or mineralized sludge, usually containing 3–17 times higher nutrient concentrations. RAS effluents (wastewater and sludge combined) contain adequate N, P, Mg, Ca, S, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni to meet most aquaponic crop needs. K is generally deficient requiring a full-fledged fertilization. Micronutrients B, Mo are partly sufficient and can be easily ameliorated by increasing sludge release. The presumption surrounding ‘definite’ phyto-toxic Na levels in RAS effluents should be reconsidered – practical solutions available too. No threat of heavy metal accumulation or discharge was observed. Most of the ‘well-known’ operational influences failed to show any significant predictable power in deciding nutrient throughput from RAS systems. Calibration of nutrient output from operational RAS farms may be primarily focused around six predictors we identified. Despite inherent complexity of effluents, the conversion of RAS farms to semi-commercial aquaponics should not be deterred by nutrient insufficiency or nutrient safety arguments. Incentivizing RAS farm wastes through semi-commercial aquaponics should be encouraged - sufficient and safe nutrients are available.},

The shelter is another mandatory requirement for humans to survive on Mars. Techniques and approaches such as 3D printing, inflatable shelters, caves, and lava tubes are discussed in the article. To fully colonize Mars, terraforming is recommended as it creates an Earth-like environment and allows humans to live on Mars as if they live on Earth. However, it could take hundreds of years to achieve the terraforming goal. The combined use of all these techniques can make a suitable environment for the life of humans on Mars, and the goal of colonizing Mars is feasible and achievable.},

  abstract = {This study was carried out in order to compare the daily energy needs in three fish species: gilthead sea bream, European sea bass and white grouper. The requirements for maintenance and growth and the efficiencies for protein and lipid deposition were estimated. The energy requirement for maintenance is proportional to the metabolic body weight in the form of a Â BW(kg)b, whereas the requirement for growth is dependent on the amount and the composition of the added tissue. The exponent b of the metabolic body weight was determined by energy loss during starvation using fish ranging from 1 to 400 g. Similar values of 0.82, 0.80 and 0.79 were determined for the three species. The efficiencies of digestible energy for growth were determined by feeding fish at increasing levels, starting at zero and up to close to maximum voluntary feed intake. Digestible energy intake and the subsequent energy gain partitioned into protein and lipid gain were measured by comparative slaughter technique. Plotting the relationships (x = DE intake, y = energy gain) for each fish species, the resulting equations proved to be linear throughout, defining the efficiency of utilization of energy by the value of the slope. As the energy gain consists of protein, as well as lipid energy, a multiple regression was employed to determine the energy coefficients for protein and lipid deposition simultaneously with the maintenance requirement: DE intake (kJ) = DEmaint + 1/kP Â protein energy (kJ) + 1/kL Â lipid energy (kJ).},

  abstract = {Nature-based solutions including rooftop-water storage ponds are increasingly adopted in cities as new ecodesigns to address climate change issues, such as water scarcity and storm-water runoff. Macrophytes may be valuable additions for treating stored rooftop waters and provisioning other services, including aquaponics, esthetic and wildlife-conservation values. However, the efficacy of macrophyte treatments has not been tested with influxes of different labile carbon loadings such as those occurring in storms. Moreover, little is known about how macrophytes affect communities of metazoans and microbes, including protozoans, which are key players in the water-treatment process. Here, we experimentally investigated the effectiveness of two widely distributed macrophytes, Ceratophyllum demersum and Egeria densa, for treating drained rooftop water fed with two types of leaf litter, namely Quercus robur (high C lability) and Quercus rubra (low C lability). C. demersum was better than E. densa at reducing water conductivity (by 10̶ 40 µS/cm), TDS (by 10–18 mg/L), DOC (by 4–5 mg/L) and at increasing water transparency (by 4–9\%), water O2 levels (by 19–27\%) and daylight pH (by 0.9–1.3) compared to leaf-litter only microcosms after 30 days. Each treatment developed a different community of algae, protozoa and metazoa. Greater plant mass and epiphytic chlorophyll-a suggested that C. demersum was better at providing supporting habitat than E. densa. The two macrophytes did not differ in detritus accumulation, but E. densa was more prone to develop filamentous bacteria, which cause sludge bulking in water-treatment sys­ tems. Our study highlights the superior capacity of C. demersum and the usefulness of whole-ecosystem exper­ iments in choosing the most adequate macrophyte species for nature-based engineered solutions.},

However, the effect of this culture approach on the lipid composition of halophytes remains unknown. In this work, we contrasted the polar lipidome of Salicornia ramosissima and Halimione portulacoides when produced in marine aquaponics (effluent from a super-intensive flatfish aquaculture production), with that of conspecifics from donor wild populations. Phospholipids and glycolipids were identified and quantified by LC-MS and MS/ MS and their profile statistically analysed. Halophytes produced in aquaponics have higher levels of glycolipids with n-3 fatty acids (DGDG 36:3; SQDG 36:3; MGDG 36:6) compared with the donor wild populations. In the case of H. portulacoides, a significant increase of phospholipids bearing n-3 fatty acids (most in PC and PE) was also recorded. These lipids have potential applications in food, feed and pharmaceutical industries, contributing to the valorization of halophytes produced under sustainable aquaculture practices.},

  abstract = {Using effluent from the anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) of the decentralised wastewater treatment system (DEWATS) as a sole nutrient source is not sufficient for tomato plants grown in hydroponic system. The study investigated the effects of commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix (CHFM) combined with ABR effluent on tomato growth and yield. A media-based hydroponic technique consisting of three treatments, namely, ABR effluent, CHFM, and ABR effluent combined with CHFM (ABR þ CHFM (50:50 v/v) was used. The results showed that plant growth parameters, biomass, fruit yield and shoot nutrient content were significantly higher in tomato plants fed with CHFM and ABR þ CHFM than those grown in ABR effluent. Addition of 50 \% dose of CHFM in ABR wastewater (ABR þ CHFM) increased shoot N, K, Ca and Zn. These results indicated that adding 50\% CHFM can alleviate nutrient deficiencies when partially treated wastewater from anaerobic digester is used as a nutrient source for hydroponic tomato cultivation.},

  abstract = {Endophytic bacteria have been explored for their role in plant growth promotion, however, not much has been explored in cucumber. The metabolomic response of plants to application of such microbes also remains largely unknown. Thus, we investigated the application of endophytic bacteria to cucumber to infer their role in plant growth promotion and document metabolome response. The lowest healthy leaf-stalks were sampled from four differently sourced cucumber plants, and endophytic bacteria were isolated after surface disinfection. Initial plant growth-promoting (PGP) screening was performed to identify PGP strains out of numerous isolates, and five strains (Strains 4=Curtobacterium spp., 72=Brevibacillus spp., 167=Paenibacillus spp., 193=Bacillus spp., and 227=Microbacterium spp.) were selected based on their contribution to root growth compared with the control. The selected strains were further evaluated in pot experiments, axenic PGP trait assays, and metabolomic analysis. Results revealed that the selected isolates possessed different qualitative characteristics among indole acetic acid, siderophore production, phosphate solubilization, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)-deaminase and nifH genes, and all isolates significantly enhanced plant growth in both pot experiments compared with the uninoculated control and fertilizer control. Metabolomic profiling revealed that both strains affected the plant metabolomes compared with the uninoculated control. Around 50 \% of the metabolites explored had higher concentrations in either or both bacteria-applied plants compared with the uninoculated control. Differences were observed in both strains’ regulation of metabolites, although both enhanced root growth near equally. Overall, endophytic bacteria significantly enhanced plant growth and tended to produce or induce release of certain metabolites within the plant endosphere.},

The nutrient concentration can vary depending on the development phase, cultivation system, temperature, soil conditions, luminosity, relative humidity and management practices. The aim of this work was to characterize cherry tomato visual symptoms of deficiency, as well as the effect of nutritional restriction on the development and nutrient concentration of plants cultivated in nutrient solution. Plants of the cherry tomato, cultivar Sindy, were grown in green house. We have used eleven treatments, one control with complete nutrient solution and the other ten omitting respectively the nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, zinc and iron. The experiment was performed in randomized design with three repetitions. After 60 days, the plants were removed from the solutions and their main symptoms were photographed and described. The traits evaluated were: total dry matter yield, dry matter of leaves, dry matter of stems and dry matter of roots; number of leaves, number of inflorescences; number of fruits and root volume. The concentration and accumulation of nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, zinc and iron in leaves, stems and roots were evaluated. Nutrient concentration and accumulation were influenced by the deficiencies imposed. The visual symptoms of deficiency that had appeared firstly were those of phosphorus, boron and iron, respectively. The omissions of the nutrients nitrogen, magnesium and boron were the ones that most compromised the dry matter production of the cherry tomato plants.},

In the present study, an aquaponic system consisting of a 500 L fish tank, sedimentation and pH control tank, degassing tank and three vegetable growing beds was assembled and tested for 17 weeks. Fifty Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus) were reared and fed thrice daily with a complete diet containing 32\% protein. Buffer of solid rocks (dead corals) were installed for pH control. Water convolvulus (Ipomoea aquatica) and Tokyo Bekana (Brassica rapa) were rotationally grown at different growth stages. Water samples were collected once a week to analyze pH and NH3/NH4+, NO3-, H2PO4-/HPO42-, SO42-, K, Na, Ca, Mg and Fe concentrations. Fish weight increased from 50 g/fish at the beginning of the experiment to 228 g/fish after 15 weeks. Water pH increased from 6.0 before rearing to 7.0 on the 4th week and varied over the range of 6.9 to 7.0 until the end of the experiment without any additional acid or alkali. Total NH3/NH4+ increased to 10.2 mg-N/L on the 2nd week and rapidly declined to levels below 2.0 mg-N/L. Phosphate, SO42-, Na and Mg accumulated in the system, whereas Ca gradually increased and reached equilibrium at 47±2 mg/L. K and NO2-/NO3- varied considerably at concentrations lower than the general requirement of the vegetables. The first crops of vegetables initially grew well, but growth rates declined remarkably and latter crops showed complex nutrient deficiency. The system could be maintained for 17 weeks without waste discharge.},

  abstract = {Recycling of nutrients from organic sources and modifying farming practices towards sustainable agriculture have gained considerable attention in recent years. This is due to the growing awareness of the declining environmental quality and arable land, and significant depletion of oil and water reserves that drive agriculture production. This study evaluated the impacts of three Azospirillum brasilense strains (i.e. Sp7, Sp7-S and Sp245) on the growth of vegetable seedlings (i.e. tomato, lettuce and cucumber) fertilized with fish effluent. Seeds and seedlings were inoculated prior to germination and transplanting, respectively, and were grown in a greenhouse with natural light. Results show that inoculation with these strains increased root length and endogenous plant IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) of all vegetables. Inoculated tomato seedlings produced bigger leaves, higher dry plant biomass and protein content. Likewise, taller plants with bigger stems and more leaves, and higher fresh plant biomass were documented, but with Sp7 only. Strain Sp245 also triggered an increase of peroxidase enzyme activity. In lettuce, inoculation produced taller seedlings, more leaves and higher peroxidase activity. Chlorophyll and protein content were also increased, but with Sp7 only. In cucumber, inoculated seedlings increased seedling root biomass with higher total phosphorus content and peroxidase activity. Furthermore, inoculation caused little or no adverse impact on the fish effluent bacterial community indicating that these strains can be integrated into production system that utilizes fish effluent as a fertilizer, e.g. Aquaponics. A. brasilense could be a valuable agent to help maximize the usefulness of fish effluent or wastewater from freshwater aquaculture for plant production.},

In this study, we compared the use of genetically modified bioluminescent (GMB) bacteria whose luminescence increases in the presence of toxicants and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the characterization of the toxicity of water samples collected from a lake and streams, hydroponic and aquaponic farms, and a wastewater treatment plant. GMB bacteria were used to probe genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species-induced effects in the whole water samples. Unlike GMB bacteria, the use of CHO cells requires XAD resin-based pre-concentration of toxic material present in water samples for the subsequent cytotoxicity assay. In addition to the examination of the toxicity of the water from the different sources, the GMB bacteria were also used to test the XAD extracts diluted to the concentrations causing 50\% growth inhibition of the CHO cells. The two biomonitoring tools provided different results when they were used to test the above-mentioned diluted XAD extracts. A pre-concentration procedure based on adsorption by XAD resins with subsequent elution was not sufficient to represent the ma­ terial responsible for the toxicity of the whole water samples toward the GMB bacteria. Therefore, the use of XAD resin extracts may lead to major underestimates of the toxicity of water samples. Although the toxicity findings obtained using the GMB bacteria and CHO cells may not correlate with each another, the GMB bacteria assay did provide a mechanism-specific biomonitoring tool to probe the toxicity of water samples without a need for the pre-concentration step.},

  abstract = {The conception of Aquaponics is a synergistic combination of aquaculture and hydroponics that nurture plants with aquaculture water. It is the internationally improved agricultural practices, are needed to assuage rural poverty and enhance food security. Aquaponics is a soil-less combined approach to proficient and sustainable intensification of agriculture that meets the needs of water scarcity inventiveness and generated modern farming practices in agriculture. The nutrient-rich fish water from the fish tanks is used to fertigate hydroponic production beds. To improve the production efficiency can be used bio fertilizers (Aquaponic water and Gracilaria corticata extract) as a liquid it contains organic macro, micronutrient and growth hormones. Tilapia fish produced the nutrient that is utilized by the plant Trigonella foenum- graecum L. The Physico-chemical parameter of both bio fertilizers should be assessed by using the standard procedures. The fish effluent water is compared with the Gracilaria corticata red seaweed extract by foliar spray and combining with both liquid bio fertilizers (Aquaponic water and seaweed extracts). Morphological growths of the plants were assessed. The combination of Aquaponic water and Gracilaria corticata seaweed extract was given the good result, but the estimation (15.26± 0.29, 24.06± 0.27, 30± 0.64, 35.94 ±0.28 cm plant height at 7, 14, 21 and 28 DAS) (2.6± 0.1 branches at 30, DAS) (533.67 ±11and 51 ± 1 mg shoot and root fresh weight per plant) leaf area (46.62±0.89cm2) at 28 DAS was related to the Aquaponic water in the plant Trigonella foenum- graecum L. Thus, the present result revealed that the integrated aquaponic system is the new agricultural farming systems with liquid bio fertilizers are eco- friendly practice for food security.},

  abstract = {The Vesuvian Piennolo cherry tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller) (PdP) is an old and typical variety grown in the Campania region (Italy). PdP is referred to as a long-storage tomato due to its thick and coriaceous skin that allows long post-harvest storage and it has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status since 2009. In this study, the chemical composition, focusing in particular on organic acids, antioxidant molecules and volatile compounds, were investigated in PdP and compared to another typical variety in Campania, the Ciliegino tomato (CIL). Chemical characterization was evaluated for both the CIL and PdP varieties during storage in the same environmental conditions until deterioration of 50\% of the fruits; deterioration occurred in PdP after 6 months and in CIL tomatoes after 1 month. The results demonstrated variation in the chemical profiles of both varieties with storage length. Particularly, the PdP variety appears richer in antioxidants compounds (i.e., chlorogenic acids and lycopene) and organic acids (i.e., glutamic and malic acids) than does CIL. Additionally, both varieties display different profiles of volatile bioactive compounds and they are differently influenced by the storage time. The results indicate a typical chemical composition of this long-storage tomato closely linked to the geographic origin area.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to compare the morphological traits and growth performance of monosex populations of the Genetic Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) and Saint Peter® of male tilapias reared in a mixed system. The experiment was carried out from June 2012 to November 2012 in Sgarbi fish farm, Palotina, Paraná State, Brazil. GIFT juveniles were obtained from the State University of Maringá (UEM/Codapar) fish farm broodstock, and the red hybrids were from the Sgarbi fish farm broodstock. The average genetic values of GIFT from three genetic groups (I, II, and III) were obtained by controlling individual pedigree and genetic evaluation using Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP). Information from complete GIFT pedigree since its introduction in Brazil was used, and the genetic groups were ranked as I (upper group), II (middle group), and III (inferior group). In all, 1,880 fish, including 480 GIFT strain and 1,400 red hybrids, with an average initial weight of 15 g, were placed in a semi-intensive system with a density of 4.7 fish m-2. The fish were individually identified using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags. Harvesting was performed at the end of a 160 d period. The performance data including final weight and daily weight gain, and morphological traits including total length, standard length, body depth, head length, tail depth, tail width, body width, head length/standard length, body area and body volume were evaluated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey test at 5\% probability level were applied. The average final weight and daily weight gain among the three genetic groups of GIFT did not show significant differences. However all GIFT groups (I, II, and III) presented average values of performance and morphological traits higher that the Saint Peter®. Among the GIFT genetic groups, only body depth between groups I and III showed significant differences (p{$<$}0.001). The morphological traits and growth performance are superior in the GIFT strain, regardless of its genetic group, when compared to Saint Peter®, except for the head length/standard length ratio.},

  abstract = {As population is growing, limitations on natural resources is also increasing. Consequently, there is a need to use natural resources such as water and land efficiently as much as possible. Traditional farming methods depend on reliable rainfall. In the realm of rainfall variability, other methods are needed to avert famine. Currently, in Zimbabwe, aquaponic systems are being considered as the best way to avert famine. This study was done at St. Peter’s Mbare Secondary School where there is complete and operational aquaponic system. The system basically faced the frequent power outages leading to interruptions in running of pumps. This impacted continuous oxygen flow causing the fish dying. However, Zimbabwe has enormous potential of solar PV not yet exploited. The objective of this research was to harness solar energy and integrate it to traditional aquaponics thereby making the system sustainable and innovative (automated) supplied by a standalone PV system. A 1.6 kW solar PV array was sized to run an electrical load of 293.2 W meant of water pump, aerator and electronics devices. The system was automated using Arduino based system to monitor the pH, temperature and water flow velocity in the Aquaponic system. The designed system is scalable and would serve a model to be implemented in other localities.},

Aquaponics resembles a natural river or lake basin in which fish waste serves as nutrients for the plants, which in turn clean the water for the fish. Tilapia and salad greens or herbs are common fish and plants grown in an aquaponics system. The external inputs to an aquaponics system are fish food, a minimal volume of replacement water, and energy for lighting and heating the water. Aquaponics is particularly suited to arid climates because it uses much less water to grow plants than soil-based systems. In fact, the only water that is lost from an aquaponics systems is by evaporation and transpiration from the plants.},

The set up included four different experimental combinations that were periodically monitored for 5 months. After this period, polychaete-assisted sand filters reduced in 70\% the percentage of OM and the average densities increased from ≈ 400 ind. m− 2to 7000 ind. m− 2. H. portulacoides in aquaponics contributed to an average DIN (Dissolved inorganic Nitrogen) decrease of 65\%, which increased to 67\% when preceded by filter tanks stocked with polychaetes. From May until October (5 months) halophytes biomass increased from 1.4 kg m− 2 ± 0.7 (initial wet weight) to 18.6 kg m− 2 ± 4.0. Bearing in mind that the uptake of carbon is mostly via photosynthesis and not though the uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon, this represents an approximate incorporation of ≈ 1.3 kg m− 2carbon (C), ≈ 15 g m− 2nitrogen (N) and ≈ 8 g m− 2phosphorus (P) in the aerial part (76\% of total biomass), and an approximate incorporation of ≈ 0.5 kg m− 2carbon (C), ≈ 3 g m− 2nitrogen (N) and ≈ 2 g m− 2phosphorus (P) in the roots (24\% of total biomass). In the present study, the potential of the two extractive species for biomitigation of a super-intensive marine fish farm effluent could be clearly demonstrated, contributing in this way to potentiate the implementation of more sustainable practices.},

  abstract = {The HortSyst model is a new discrete time model for describing the dynamics of photo-thermal time (PTI), total dry matter production (DMP), N uptake (Nup), leaf area index (LAI), and evapotranspiration (ETc) for greenhouse crops. The first three variables are considered as state variables and the latter two are conceptualized as output variables. This model was developed as a tool for decision support systems in Mexican greenhouses for the application of N and water in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production. The HortSyst has 13 parameters. It was used to calibrate the model and estimate the correct parameter values for the crop season. An experiment was carried out to test model predictions in a greenhouse during the autumn-winter season in Chapingo, Mexico. Tomato ‘CID F1’ was grown in a hydroponic system and plants were distributed with a density of 3.5 plants m-2. The tomato crop was transplanted on 21 August 2015. A weather station was installed inside the greenhouse to measure temperature, relative humidity, and global radiation. The HortSyst model provides an excellent predictive quality for DMP, Nup, LAI, and ETc according to the statistics. Values for bias (BIAS) were DMP (-3.897), Nup (-0.071), LAI (0.026), and ETc (3.647), values for root mean square error (RMSE) were DMP (14.543), Nup (0.500), LAI (0.100), and ETc (39.330), and values for modeling efficiency (EF)were DMP (0.996), Nup (0.991), LAI (0.998), and ETc (0.815). The model proposed and described in this paper can be integrated as a decision support tool for N supply and irrigation management in greenhouse production systems.},

To evaluate the chemical compositions of these species, dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent  ber, acid detergent  ber, lignin, ash, ether extract, gross energy, calcium, and phosphorus of the aquatic plants were determined. Based on the results of this study, aquatic plants are considered to ful ll most of the nutritional requirements of productive animal species. Therefore, it is feasible to use them as the main ingredient in whole animal rations, with an emphasis on Myriophyllum aquaticum and Lemna minor as alternative food sources for di erent animal species, opening the way to aquaponic fodder production. Aquatic plants are interesting alternative, unconventional feed sources, especially because their high growth rates and nutritional qualities make it feasible to use them for animal consumption. However, Salvinia molesta has no value as fodder, especially because of its lignin concentration, which could a ect the fodder digestibility.},

Assim, a água fica limpa de novo e disponível para os peixes. Este circuito fechado permite aumentar a produção de alimentos de forma sustentada, poupar água e evitar poluição dos solos e das águas. A aquaponia é um conceito transversal a diversos contextos, que vão desde o nível local, de uma agricultura de subsistência, até um nível global, marcado pela sobrepopulação e pela depleção de recursos. Por este motivo, a aquaponia tem vindo a ser abordada de forma emergente por programas de educação ambiental um pouco por todo o mundo. A EPAMAC é uma escola profissional em Portugal, que está presente em diversos projetos associados ao tema e tem vindo a revelar-se uma instituição embaixadora do conceito de aquaponia no sistema educativo português.},

  abstract = {The dual objective of sustainable aquaculture, i.e., to produce food while sustaining natural resources is achieved only when production systems with a minimum ecological impact are used. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs) provide opportunities to reduce water usage and to improve waste management and nutrient recycling. RAS makes intensive fish production compatible with environmental sustainability. This review aims to summarize the most recent developments within RAS that have contributed to the environmental sustainability of the European aquaculture sector. The review first shows the ongoing expansion of RAS production by species and country in Europe. Life cycle analysis showed that feed, fish production and waste and energy are the principal components explaining the ecological impact of RAS. Ongoing developments in RAS show two trends focusing on: (1) technical improvements within the recirculation loop and (2) recycling of nutrients through integrated farming. Both trends contributed to improvements in the environmental sustainability of RAS. Developments within the recirculation loop that are reviewed are the introduction of denitrification reactors, sludge thickening technologies and the use of ozone. New approached towards integrated systems include the incorporation of wetlands and algal controlled systems in RAS. Finally, the review identifies the key research priorities that will contribute to the future reduction of the ecological impact of RAS. Possible future breakthroughs in the fields of waste production and removal might further enhance the sustainabilty of fish production in RAS.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;Rapid population growth and rising economic prosperity are imperatively challenging the South Mediterranean and the African North-East to a point where they may compromise the sustainable use of natural resources. In those regions, the demand for water, energy, food, and the preservation of ecosystems are expected to increase relevantly. Transboundary rivers like the Nile River Basin represent an enormous source of water, energy, food, and ecosystems (WEFE), which often brings conflicts and individualistic policies among the sharing countries. The adoption of integrated and participatory approaches that explicitly account for the WEFE Nexus are necessary to explore multisectoral synergies and tradeoffs and to generate shared economic, environmental, and societal benefits.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Focused on the Nile River Basin and born in this context, we present here the AWESOME project (i.e. mAnaging Water, Ecosystems and food across sectors and Scales in the sOuth Mediterranean), whose main objective is developing a decision-analytic framework based on a multi-level, integrated WEFE model to address the Nexus and explore the interdependencies and feedbacks across a hierarchy of spatial scales, from the macroeconomic development (macro), to regional planning (meso), down to the single farm (local).\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;At the local scale, a demo-site of smart agricultural solutions (soilless agriculture, e.g., hydroponics, aquaponics) is currently under construction, and it will provide indicators on effectiveness and sustainability of these new technologies to back up existing systems in a dryer future. The study on site will also demonstrate the performance of such a technology within its local economy and ecosystem. At the meso scale, we are developing a decision-analytic framework covering the course of the Nile River Basin, from the Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia up to the Nile Delta, based on hydrological models and combined with the results of systems analysis methods with advanced a-posteriori multi-objective optimization algorithms. We plan to simulate existing water availability, water distributions system and new agricultural technologies, upscaling the local scale assessments while downscaling the climate, energy, crop, and ecosystems projections at the macro scale. This approach allows the design of a set of efficient solutions and associated performance with respect to the WEFE multidimensional assessment space, where stakeholders and policy makers will be able to explore multisectoral tradeoffs and negotiate potential compromise alternatives.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;We expect that AWESOME will make substantial progress in complex systems analysis to support the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient agriculture along the Nile River Basin under diverging water availability and demand due to the projected impacts of changing climate and society.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become a widely accepted method of evaluating the environmental impact of products and services. In this context, the aims of this paper were:1) to create a low-price AP system for possible use as didactic tool using recovered material; 2) to evaluate the environmental impact of a micro AP model (1.5 m2) through LCA analysis; 3) to verify whether this micro AP model is representative of full-scale AP systems ({$>$}50 m2) in terms of water quality and water consumption. Both, the water quality and the average daily water consumption of our system were in line with data reported in literature for larger aquaponics. LCA shows that materials and energy flows linked to the system management practices and energy consumption principally contribute to environmental impacts. The cumulative annual energy demand of micro aquaponic system was 1040.5 kWh; assuming that this system was built for a class of 25 students, the energy consumption of the learning activity using the proposed micro aquaponic system would be 41.6 kWh studentÀ1 yearÀ1. The results showed that the micro aquaponic system reliably mimics a fullscale unit and that it is a teaching tool with a relatively low environmental impact.},

  abstract = {As in any agroecosystem, also in aquaponics the nitrogen (N) balance represents an important tool to evaluate sustainability, and to identify factors that can improve N use efficiency (NUE) and reduce N losses. In this respect, fish stocking density has been little investigated, hence this research aimed to evaluate the N balance of a low technology aquaponic (AP) system managed at two fish densities in comparison with a hydroponic system (HP). In the fish tanks common carp at two initial stocking densities were reared (2.5 and 4.6 kg m–3 in low and high AP, hereafter named APL and APH, respectively) and the vegetated sector was cultivated with a leafy vegetable crop succession (Catalogna chicory, lettuce, Swiss chard). The N balance considered N input as fish feed or fertiliser, and N content in the initial water and the N output as N in the incremented fish biomass, in the harvested vegetables, in the sediments, and in the remaining water. Total N loss was estimated by difference. The total N input and the N loss through gas emission in the atmosphere were much higher in AP than in HP, particularly at high stocking density. The opposite trend was observed for the N input recovered in vegetable aboveground biomass. The N input recovered as fish biomass was slightly higher in APL compared to APH. The better results of APL than APH suggest that in low-tech AP system lower initial fish density should be adopted at the system start up to maximise both production and N recovery.  ~  Highlights - The higher initial fish density had higher N input, but resulted in a lower N recovered in fish and vegetable biomass, and much higher N loss as gas emissions. - The lower initial fish density combined a lower N input to a higher recovery in fish and vegetable biomass, and a lower N loss as gas emissions. - The lower initial fish density allowed to maximise both production and environmental preservation.},

(lettuce) and Cichorium intybus L. rubifolium group (red chicory) intercropping in the hydroponic section. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Wädenswil, Switzerland, using nine small-scale aquaponic systems (each approximately 400 L), with the nutrient film technique (NFT). The intercropping of vegetables did not influence the water temperature, pH, electric conductivity (EC), oxidation–reduction potential, nor O2 content. Intercropping with red chicory increased the lettuce sugar content (+16.0\% and +25.3\% for glucose and fructose, respectively) and reduced the lettuce caffeic acid content (−16.8\%). In regards to bitter taste compounds (sesquiterpene lactones), intercropping reduced the concentrations of dihydro-lactucopicrin + lactucopicrin (−42.0\%) in lettuce, and dihydro-lactucopicrin + lactucopicrin (−22.0\%) and 8-deoxy–lactucin + dihydro-lactucopicrin oxalate (−18.7\%) in red chicory, whereas dihydro-lactucin content increased (+40.6\%) in red chicory in regards to monoculture. A significantly higher organic nitrogen content was found in the lettuce (3.9\%) than in the red chicory biomass (3.4\%), following the intercropping treatment. Anion and cation contents in vegetables were affected by species (Cl−, NO3−, PO43−, SO42−, and Ca2+), intercropping (K+ and Mg2+), and species × intercropping interactions (NO2− and NH4+). Experimental treatments (monoculture vs intercropping and distance from NFT inlet) did not exert significant effects on leaf SPAD (index of relative chlorophyll content) values, whereas the red coloration of the plants increased from the inlet to the outlet of the NFT channel. Intercropping of lettuce and red chicory affected the typical taste of these vegetables by increasing the sweetness of lettuce and changing the ratio among bitter taste compounds in red chicory. These results suggest intercropping as a possible solution for improving vegetable quality in aquaponics. Although the results are interesting, they have been obtained in a relatively short period, thus investigations for longer periods are necessary to confirm these findings. Further studies are also needed to corroborate the positive effect of the presence of red chicory in the system on fish production parameters.},

  abstract = {A series of experiments were undertaken to compare the effects of individual and combined applications of GA4+7 and prohexadione-Ca (P-Ca) on scarf skin and fruit quality parameters on red strains of ÔRome BeautyÕ and ÔGalaÕ apples. Three applications of GA4+7 at 10-day intervals beginning at petal fall (PF) significantly reduced scarf skin severity in all experiments. A single application of P-Ca at PF had no effect on scarf skin in one experiment but reduced scarf skin severity in two further experiments. Combining P-Ca with the first of three GA4+7 sprays as a tank mix reduced the severity of scarf skin more effectively than either material alone in two of three experiments at P {$<$} 0.05 and in all three experiments at P {$<$} 0.10. Combining P-Ca with the first application of GA4+7 as a tank mix generally reduced scarf skin as effectively as applying P-Ca and the first GA4+7 spray two days apart, although in one experiment, greater scarf skin control was achieved when P-Ca was applied 2 days after the first GA4+7 spray. A single application of P-Ca at PF consistently reduced, and three applications of GA4+7 consistently increased, mean fruit weight at harvest compared with the control. The economic benefits as a result of reducing scarf skin severity with P-Ca and GA4+7 sprays will need to be balanced against the negative effect of P-Ca on mean fruit weight. There is no antagonism between early season P-Ca and GA4+7 sprays for scarf skin control, and P-Ca may increase the efficacy of GA4+7 sprays for scarf skin control in apple.},

  abstract = {The global agricultural system has become a major source of stress on the earth’s natural resources. The current food production and distribution system is not secure and will not sustain future populations as global food production pressures intensify. It will be important to explore other avenues of food production in order to build a more sustainable system in the future. Aquaponics eliminates soil from the equation of food production by combining aquaculture(fish farming) and hydroponics(growing plants in water saturated media). Aquaponics may provide a source of relief for areas without suitable soil or dense human populations. This experiment looks to explore system efficiency by altering the design of the grow bed. This was done through a comparative analysis between two control beds and two augment beds. Each augment bed was fixed with a greenhouse glazing which encompassed the entire grow bed. We hypothesized that greenhouse glazing can be used in indoor aquaponic systems to improve efficiency thus productivity. Three sets of data were collected in this experiment; air temperatures between control bed 3 and augment bed 1, dry weight analysis based on shoot to root ratio(S:R), and nitrate(NO3) concentrations which was analyzed with an ion chromatography system. The experimental data suggest that when there is no nitrate deficiency in a system, temperature can have an increasing effect on S:R. Furthermore we conclude that the greenhouse glazing was effective in capturing heat which yielded higher S:R in the augment beds. We do recommend more experimentation be done on the validity of using S:R as a metric for productivity in an aquaponic system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture (fish) and hydroponic culture (plants) as one system. Aquaponics requires a sound simultaneous understanding of two agricultural ecosystems (fish and plants) in order to have a viable system. Modelling and model development is sacrosanct in systems where productivity is uncertain or complex. The study was conducted in 2016 to collect aquaponics information in the Republic of South Africa (RSA) using an online survey questionnaire to determine local aquaponics uses, management and distribution. A total of 44 aquaponics operators were captured within three months (September-November) in 2016. In this study, it was shown and concluded that most aquaponics practitioners in RSA do not have adequate knowledge and skills in aquaponics production and management, and that development of the localised aquaponics model is important for South Africa. As a result, the aim of this study was to develop a model that is more specific to South African conditions in order to help South Africans to have a better opportunity to establish and operate aquaponic systems. This study was designed as a mixed approach combining different methods and sources of data to develop the model. Unified Modelling Language (UML), Microsoft excel, an online survey, observations, structured and unstructured interviews and content data were used. The developed model was able to predict the main aquaponics inputs variables, namely fish stocking density, daily fish feed, and required planting area. The fit for each of these variables was good to average with R=0.7477, 0.6957, and 0.4313 respectively. There were no significant differences (P{$<$}0.05) between the observed and simulated data for all variables (fish stocking density, daily fish and planting area variables). Therefore, it was concluded that this model can be adopted by aquaponics practitioners in RSA and extension officers or facilitators as an aquaponics start-up platform.},

The aim of this study was to apply aquaponics decision-making tool to provide potential aquaponics production data and information for South Africa. This study was designed as 2×3×3 factorial study giving 18 interactions. Because aquaponics are the production of fish and crops concurrently, yield production had two levels- fish and crop, fish stocking density had three levels- low, optimum and higher and aquaponics scale of production had 3 levels- hobby, subsistence and commercial scale. The summary of data of aquaponics variables from the literature was used as optimum level, lower and higher levels were based on experimental design. Yield production (kg) of both fish and plants increased significantly (p{$<$}0.05) as fish stocking density was increased. In hobby scale, plants yield was higher than fish yield in all levels of fish stocking density, the plant-fish yield (kg) was 40-33, 80-67 and 150-133, respectively. In subsistence scale, fish-plant yield (kg) was 240-200, 300-267 and 400-333, respectively. In commercial scale, fish-plant yield (kg) was 600-533, 1 100-1 000, 1 500-1 333, respectively.

Aquaponics are still an emerging practice worldwide, but particularly in South Africa. This study was conducted in 2016 using an online survey questionnaire to collect information about the types of systems used, the management and distribution of aquaponics in South Africa. A total of 44 responses were captured within three months. The most commonly raised fish was tilapia (82\%). The most commonly raised plants were leafy vegetables (75\%). Since aquaponics is still not practiced by many and aquaponics systems are mostly small, aquaponics in South Africa can be considered an emerging practice. Most of the current aquaponics practitioners have limited aquaponics production knowledge. We therefore conclude that attention should be paid to raising the awareness about the potential of aquaponics, and raising the technological knowledge of aquaponics operators to increase the number of aquaponics operations and to increase the total amount of food produced in and with aquaponics.},

This study compares the effects of two aquafeeds on Red amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor) productivity and on water quality parameters under cultivation of Blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus), in three aquaponic replicate units per treatment over a 60-day experimental trial. The fishmeal-based control feed contains higher crude protein (40 \%) and phosphorus (1.12 \%) than the plant-based alternative feed (32 \% and 0.40 \%, respectively). The alternative feed resulted in a significantly higher amaranth crop yield (p \textbackslash{} 0.05), with significantly lower concentrations of nitrate-N (NO3-N) and total dissolved solids (TDS) in the aquaponic culture water over the course of the experiment. Orthophosphate (PO4-P), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels were not significantly different between the control and alternative aquafeed treatments. Economic analysis revealed that improved plant productivity from the plant-based, lower-protein aquafeed may potentially increase total aquaponic farm revenue despite reduced fish production.},

Anaerobic digestion is considered to be a useful tool that can generate renewable energy and significant research interest has arisen recently. The underlying theory of anaerobic digestion has been established for decades; however, a great deal of current research is directed towards the optimization of anaerobic digestion under diverse digestion conditions. This review provides a summary of the processes underlying anaerobic digestion, commonly-utilized measurements of anaerobic sludge, operating parameters of anaerobic digesters, and methods of acceleration and optimization used to improve process efficiency. Recent developments in addition to older research are considered to provide a general but comprehensive summary of accumulated knowledge in the theory of anaerobic digestion, as well as considerations in the efficient operation of digesters. We have determined that the numerous factors pertinent to the design and operation of batch-based anaerobic digesters must each be considered to ensure the maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness of a digester provided its respective operating conditions.},

Among the species produced in freshwater are tilapia, frogs and shrimps. These species present high nutritional value and can be produced in several regions of Brazil. The state of Rio de Janeiro presents adequate climatic conditions for the creation of these species. Among the production systems used are water recirculation, a system called closed and intensive; the net tanks that are open and intensive; the ponds that can be extensive and semi-intensive. The production of aquatic organisms in captivity for human consumption will meet a demand evidenced in recent years, when production from the capture is in full decline. Fish is a food of high biological value and presents itself as a healthy food alternative and its small and medium scale production is an income alternative for producers in several regions of Brazil.},

The study was performed in the cultivar Gefner, in the period of November 2000 to March 2001, in a commercial orchard located in the county of Lins – SP, Brazil, at an altitude of 425 meters. The plants were 13 years old. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with 5 treatments and 6 replicates. The treatments were as follows: 1) manual pollination (pollen of A. squamosa); 2) manual pollination (pollen of atemoya 'Gefner'); 3) manual pollination (pollen of atemoya 'African Pride'); 4) manual pollination (pollen of atemoya 'PR-3'); 5) natural (open) pollination. The evaluation of fruit set was made 10 days after the pollination and the number of fruits with perfect (flawless) or defective shape was counted after 40 days. Atemoya fruits were picked 120 days after the pollination and individually weighed. Threefruit samples of each treatment were taken for the following determinations: seed and pulp weight, number of seeds per 100 g of pulp, total soluble solids content, total acidity and soluble solids/acidity ratio. The pollination of atemoya with pollen of A. squamosa L. was more effective, increasing the fruit set (80.5\% compared to less than 22\% in the other treatments), fruit production and percentage of marketable fruits.},

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the initial density of ornamental fish (Carassius auratus) in mini aquaponics systems, consisting of 100 L aquariums and expanded clay cultivation beds (20 L). Two densities (three and six fish per system) were evaluated with three replications. Each growing bed received one seedling of basil (Ocimium basilicum) and one of parsley (Petroselinum crispum). The fish were fed daily to apparent satiety with 32\% CP commercial feed, two to three times daily for 103 days. The highest values of fish weight gain were observed in lower density aquariums. Green mass production was higher in systems with higher initial fish density. It was concluded that the higher initial density of fish provided better production of green mass, despite presenting lower fish growth rates.},

  abstract = {Objective: a greenhouse pilot aquaponic system was installed, operated, and evaluated to produce carps-strawberrycanola. Design/methodology/approach: the proposed aquaponics system was made of four modules: 1) module for the production of carp (Cyprinus Carpio comunis), 2) hydroponic module, deep flow type for the production of duckweed (Lemna minor L.) used to feed the carps, 3) hydroponic module for the strawberry production (Fragaria  ananassa), 4) hydroponic module with substrate (medium gravel) for the canola production (Brassica napus). The carps (Cyprinus carpio) had an average weight of 0.92 g at the beginning of the study (July 2018), the density was 500 carps/0.7 m3 of water. From September to December, a sample of 5\% was taken to quantify their growth (length and weight) employing a Vernier, and a triple beam balance (OHAUS®). The carps were fed only with duckweed (Lemna minor L.). The carps were fed daily with 1.5\% of duckweed as fresh matter concerning the average live weight of the 500 carps. Module 2 had an area of 0 .26 m2. The dry matter of duckweed was quantified using a PVC cylinder that had an area of 0 .010 m2, and then the fresh sample was weighed and dried at 105 °C until constant weight. Module 3 (0.42 m2) had 23 plants in a vegetative state, the growth of 5 plants was evaluated by measuring the size of the root (cm), the height of the plant (cm), the length and width of the leaves (cm) and the foliar area (cm2). Module 4 had 0.42 m2, canola seed was sown at a density of 1.2 g/ m2 that represented 185 seedlings. The growth of 9 plants was evaluated by measuring the same variables of strawberry plants.},

  abstract = {One of the concerns regarding aquaponic systems operating without conventional soil is the limited selection of plants available for cultivation. For a wider use of aquaponic systems increasing yields are inevitable. The aim of our research, started in 2017, was to eliminate the drawbacks of aquaponic systems using alternative solutions in order to remain in the framework of sustainable agriculture. In order to meet the above challenges, a hybrid, automated aquaponic system was installed in which the soil was not removed completely from the systems that are not completely closed as fish receive fresh water as well as keeping in this way hormones impeding growth at a low level. Crucians and African catfish were placed into two tanks of 7 m3. Further novelty of the system is the application of quail dung in a quantity determined specially for increasing the natural efficiency of the system. Three methods of cultivation were used and plant macro- and micro-elements were measured. Results indicate that the system is suitable for growing different chilli types while quail dung input contributes to increase yield significantly therefore it can be integrated into aquaponic systems excellently.},

  abstract = {The call for sustainable food production and consumption has led to an increased interest and new policy measures to support the circular economy and climate-smart farming practices. The merits of aquaponics and closed-loop nutrient cycling systems are increasingly being examined in terms of sustainable productivity in various settings including urban environments. Aquaponics also has the potential to be applied as a learning tool for people of all ages but especially for young people at school. This chapter studies the potential of aquaponics to teach food and science literacy and the use of the technology as an educational tool in primary school. The chapter draws on data from the Growing Blue \& Green (GBG) program carried out in cooperation among Aalborg University, Copenhagen, municipal schools and their teachers and a private aquaponic enterprise. The chapter draws on three empirical studies including an exploratory study on the educational opportunities at school, a feasibility study carried out among teachers, as well as the educational Growing Blue \& Green (eGBG) study, in which a digital-based regulation component was added. The conclusion is that low-cost versions of aquaponics have considerable potential for supportive learning in elementary school. Preliminary findings furthermore suggest that fitting the setup with easy-to-install intelligent sensors and devices offers the opportunity to provide learning about food, sustainability, and a basic understanding of the control and management of biological systems in one package.},

  abstract = {The first commercial aquaponics companies are starting up in Europe. The main focus has been on solving technology issues and optimizing production. However, increasing attention is now being paid to certification and regulations linked to aquaponics, as well as the marketing of products and services. The paper presents the results of a study whose main aim was to estimate consumers’ knowledge about aquaponics and their acceptance of aquaponics products in different European regions. An on-line questionnaire was administered to the general public through the aquaponics network of Food and Agriculture COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action FA1305 “The EU Aquaponics Hub—Realising Sustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU” in 16 European countries. The methodology includes univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. The results show that, on average, attitudes towards aquaponics were positive, showing no significant differences between those who already knew about aquaponics and those who only heard about it through the survey. More than 50\% of respondents had never heard of aquaponics, whilst more than 70\% had already heard of hydroponics. No more than 17\% of respondents were willing to pay more for aquaponically produced products and no more than 40\% more when compared to the price of products from conventional farming. The results confirm three different clusters of potential consumers of aquaponics products. They also suggest an urgent need for implementing integrated and holistic approaches involving all stakeholders in aquaponics, in order to define a marketing plan and efficient communication strategies. This COST action, other projects and public decision makers must invest in educating consumers about aquaponics through the organization of guided tours, thematic workshops and tastings of aquaponics products in order to raise their awareness about this new technology. It is absolutely urgent that public decision makers, in cooperation with aquaponics stakeholders, address the main institutional constraints, namely the introduction of aquaponics as an economic activity and the organic certification of aquaponics products.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic food production requires a broad spectrum of knowledge in order to understand and manage the processes involved, and for commercial aquaponics to develop its full potential, it will require an appropriately trained workforce. Devised in collaboration as an Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership for Higher Education, Aqu@teach covers the basics of aquaponics with a focus on transferable and entrepreneurial skills. The aquaponics curriculum can either be taught using blended learning—combining digital media and the internet with classroom formats that require the physical co-presence of the teacher and students—or as an e-learning course. The supplementary entrepreneurial skills module was devised on the basis of two surveys: of aquaponics companies around the world, in order to get a broad overview of the skills that are important in the early years of a business; and of European higher education institutions that teach subjects where aquaponics could be incorporated as an optional module. The entrepreneurial skills curriculum introduces the main processes involved in developing a business idea into a start-up company. All of the Aqu@teach resources—the e-learning modules, textbooks, module guides for students, curriculum guides for teachers, best practice guide for teaching aquaponics, and toolbox of innovative didactic practices—are open access.},

  abstract = {Due to fresh water resource limits and environmental damage caused by aquaculture waste using systems based on sustainable development at the global level is highly regarded. Aquaponics or fish and plant coculture system is one of the new approaches to achieve aquaculture sustainable development. In this study which was conducted, in 2015, at Ahvaz Azadegan warm water fish culture complex, 6 recirculation aquaponic systems with concrete tanks (400 liters) as well as 3 one-acre soil ponds (Traditional system) were used to grow common carp. hydroponic systems with gravel substrate and tank volume ratio of 2:1 for basil (Ocimum Basilicum) culture. In this study common carp fry of mean initial body weight 6.04±0.17 g were randomly distributed in two experimental treatments. Fish were reared at two rearing densities, low density (L): 26 specimens tank-1 (65 fish per cubic meter) and high density (H): 52 specimens tank-1 (130 fish per cubic meter). In 3 oneacre soil ponds, 1100 common carp fish (0.11 fish per cubic meter) were distributed. At the end of the 60-day experimental period in low-density aquaponic system, the final Individual weight was 156.70±11.88 gr and production of 4.07 ± 0.31 kg (10.19 ± 0.77 kg / m3) and aquaponic system with high density, respectively average final Individual weight was 95.75 ± 8.15 gr and production 4.98 ± 0.42 kg (12.45 ± 1.06 kg / m3) and in soil pond average final Individual weight was 447.6 ± 26.7 gr and Production was 488.3 ± 29.1 kg / ha (0.049 ± 0.0029 kg / m3). The production in low and high density aquaponic systems was 200 and 238 times that of pond, respectively. The economic index in the pond was 1.98 and 2.46, respectively, which indicates a low cost of production of common carp in the soil pond. The water consumed to yield one kilogram common carp in the traditional system was 98 times higher than in the aquaponic systems, indicating a very high water conservation in the aquaponic system. According to the results of this study, using aquaponic system for cultivation of common carp with basil is much more efficient and more effective in saving fresh water consumption, but the economic conversion index of aquaponic system is higher than Traditional system. This fact shows high cost in aquaponic system.},

Based on the DO value we carried out a premilinary Water Quality Index (WQI) analysis using the average seasonal temperature of the study region. This index can be used as proxy to aquatic health in the study site, provided other relevant variables remain within the optimum range. The DO level varies as per the sequence monsoon {$>$} postmonsoon {$>$} premonsoon. The sudden rise of DO level and WQI during premonsoon 2009 is attributed to Aila, a super cyclone that passed across the lower Gangetic delta on 25th May, 2009 with a speed of \textasciitilde 110 km/hr.},

Compared to other production techniques, it offers several advantages thanks to its management and operating costs feasibility. Recirculating Aquaponics Systems (RAS) provides the opportunity to finely close the nutrients loop inside an ecosystem and catch the best it can offer. Here we aim to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of RAS systems. In addition, we present as a case study the RAS prototype at the Department of Agricultural Sciences of University of Naples Federico II started in November 2020 to grow leafy vegetables and tilapia fish. Results provide helpful scientific and practical information for small and/or largescale commercial growers as well as amateurs. Furthermore, our results highlight the suitability of these systems to be embedded in urban areas from rooftop and vertical farms to other controlled environment agricultural (CEA) systems and the opportunity they can offer for abandoned urban spaces.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a highly efficient production system that relies on the fish food as the only energy system’s input for growing both fish and vegetables, without chemicals. In Mediterranean climates, during winter, due to the combined effects of low solar radiation and low-temperature levels, plant metabolic activity, growth rate, and nutrient uptake decrease, which may, in turn, cause harmful accumulation of nitrogen compounds for fish in the water. Growers renew the water periodically by discharging nutrients enriched water with severe environmental and economic costs. In winter, aquaponics cultivation cycles can be integrated with supplemental light to guarantee a constant daily light integral (DLI) that could promote plant growth and nutrient uptake. The aim of the study was to evaluate the morpho-physiological response of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), escarole endive (Cichorium endivia var. latifolia), and curly endive (Cichorium endivia var. crispum) grown in a floating raft, in combination with tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in a recirculating aquaponics system (RAS). Plant were grown under natural light (NL) or natural light integrated with 16 h of supplemental white LED lighting (IL, PPFD: 173 µmol m-2 s-1, DLI, 10 mol m-2 d-1). The results showed species-specific morpho-physiological responses, with higher productivity in the endives than lettuce, under both light regimes. Compared to NL, plant biomass and leaf area were promoted under IL, accounting for higher plant photosynthetic rates. IL boosted endive growth, while lettuce leaf expansion and biomass allocation into the canopy were increased. Both lettuce and endives performed well in the adopted RAS system. It appears recommendable to provide a fixed DLI during the winter months to shorten the crop cycle by improving plant growth and nutrient uptake. However, further studies are needed to optimize the lighting application protocols and reduce energy costs too.},

Solar power is ideally can be used in Malaysia due to location factor and also give the benefit to the environment as renewable energy. It involves a combination of electrical, electronics and agriculture into one sustainable system which consists of a solar panel, inverter, water pump and air pump. The solar panel is the most cleanest ways to produce electricity. With the average output voltage is 12V while the maximum output voltage produce by the solar panel is 18 V. The voltage depends on light capture by solar panel. Weather can minimize the light capture by solar panel thus affect the overall performance. This project requires a substitution power grid with green energy from solar panel which an inverter is used to convert Direct Current (DC) to Alternate Current (AC) and to step up 12V to 110V or 240V. A microcontroller is used to control the operation of an aquaponic system for switching water pump, air pump, battery charge and discharge state. Based on observation, the output power from inverter has produced 65.55\% efficiency and the average output voltage of the solar panel is 16.16 V.},

  abstract = {The construction sector is one of the indicators of national economic growth and has contributed 4\% yearly in average to Malaysia GDP and 6\% to the national economy between 1995 - 2015. The excellent of construction growth is mainly from projects implemented under “Public-Private Partnership” (PPP) and privatization. Under 10th Malaysian Plan, 52 projects valuing about RM62.7 billion will be implemented under PFI for infrastructure works. This study aims to evaluate the project viability and the correlation between the costs and revenue collected for entirely concession period. A systematic framework for project viability of highway privatization projects has been developed based on research findings. The methodology adapted in this research is by using descriptive literature technique analysis. The research finding shows that most preferred technique used by respondents are Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Net Present Value (NPV). In sustaining the highway projects, the costs incurred during concession period should be managed efficiently. Four (4) variables are found for evaluating project’s viability and identifying which variables correlate and significantly contributes to the project viability namely operation cost, maintenance cost, actual toll traffic, and revenue. Actual traffic volume significantly correlates with the revenue meanwhile the operation cost is less correlated to the revenue. This research highlighted the viability of the privatized highway projects for entirely concession period and based on the findings, it is suggested a comprehensive framework for future project evaluation comprising of 8 components of commercial and technical evaluation for privatization highways in Malaysia need to be introduced and recommended to be implemented in the industry.},

  abstract = {Today there is a greater environmental and ecological awareness and it is growing the number of farmers who want to adopt sustainable and efficient cultivation systems even if not officially certified as organic. Sustainable and modern cultivation systems must involve organic fertilization and cannot ignore the role of rhizosphere microorganisms. Starting from this premise, this paper aimed to evaluate the use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and organic liquid fertilizers on soilless cultivation of basil. Genovese basil plants were cultivated in pots filled with a substrate inoculated or not with a commercial biostimulant (TNC BactorrS13) containing growth-promoting rhizobacteria (Bacillus spp.). Plants were fed only with water (control without fertilization) or with nutrient solutions (NS) that provided the same amount of nutrients with five combinations of mineral (M) and organic (O) fertilizers: 100 \% M, 75 \% M + 25 \% O, 50 \% M + 50 \% O, 25 \% M + 75 \% O, 100 \% O. The inoculum of the substrate with PGPR had no significant effect on basil plant growth but showed to be effective in decreasing the nitrate content of basil leaves. Several plant characteristics (e.g. yield, fresh and dry biomass, leaf number and area, stem diameter, etc.) showed to be negatively affected by the progressive reduction of the percentage of mineral fertilizer in the nutrient solution, in favor of the organic one, which, on the other hand, determined a significant reduction of the nitrate content of basil leaves.},

  abstract = {In recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), mechanical removal of suspended solids by clarifiers or drum filters provides an organic mixture rich in nutrients. Still, in most traditional RAS, this sludge is discharged directly or following dewatering. Here, the potential recycling of nutrients from sludge is assessed, comparing aerobic and anaerobic mobilization of nutrients experimentally, ultimately aiming at an application in aquaponic systems. Nutrient mobilization processes were studied, monitoring soluble nutrients photometrically in the treatment tanks (NO3−-N, NO2−-N, total ammonia nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP], K+, Mg2+ and Fe2+), the nutrient composition of the sludge (total phosphorus, Fe, Mn, Al, S, Mg, Ca) by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, as well as C:N ratio, total solids (TS) and total suspended solids (TSS). Aerobic treatment (aerated, AT) resulted in a 3.2-fold increase in mean (± SD) SRP from 9.4 (± 0.7) to 29.7 (± 2.1) mg l−1, most likely owing to a decrease in pH. In contrast, in the anaerobic treatment (unaerated, UT), SRP remained unchanged between 9.4 (± 0.7) and 9.3 (± 0.4) mg l−1. Both treatments resulted in increased K+ concentrations from 28.1 (± 1.5) to 36.8 (± 2.3) mg l−1 in AT and to 32.2 (± 2.3) mg l−1 in UT. AT revealed best mobilization of P and K+ without major losses of NO3−-N. Thus, aerobic treatment of water-sludge mixture has a high potential for significant improvements of nutrient recycling in aquaponics.},

  abstract = {Rice husk biochars were prepared by carbonization at 400–600°C. The products were analyzed by FTIR, SEM-EDS, BET, and approximate analysis in order to find final products with the best properties and the lowest carbonization temperature. It has been found that the biochar prepared at 500°C, which has 37.86\,±\,0.11\% yield, 341.0776\,m               2               /g of BET surface area, and 0.136639\,cm               3               /g of micropore volume, is suitable for use as a root supplement in the aquaponic system. The aquaponic systems consist of aquaculture and a hydroponic system with and without biochar supplement. The control experiment consists of an aquaculture and planting panel with biochar supplement disconnected from each other. Tilapia and Chinese morning glory were used for growth studies. The water quality from all aquaculture ponds has also been analyzed at an interval of 10 days for 47 days. The results showed that the growth rates of Tilapia and Chinese morning glory in the aquaponic system with biochar were clearly higher than in the control experiment, which is in accordance with the water quality in each aquaculture pond. However, the growth rates of Tilapia (23.5\,g/body vs. 22.7\,g/body) and morning glory (3.907\,g/stem vs. 2.609\,g/stem) in supplemented biochar system tend to be higher than the nonsupplemented biochar system. It has been shown that rice husk biochar can help in treating water in the aquaponic system by increasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the aquaculture water and conversion of toxic compounds to those beneficial for plant growth.},

Information gathered from comparable aquaculture and hydroponics systems was also considered for its applicability to aquaponics, and a bias assessment of accepted literature was conducted. One-hundred and forty sources were included in the review, with 85 from aquaculture systems, 55 from hydroponics, and 0 from aquaponics. Transmission was studied using cohabitation of naïve and infected organisms or direct inoculation of the water. Pathogen control methods included ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, blue light-emitting diodes, media filtration, membrane filtration, heat, sonication, and three methods that fell outside these categories. Water quality and flow rate were identified as important factors influencing disinfection efficacy, along with parameters specific to each disinfection method. The lack of studies on pathogen transmission and control in aquaponics systems, paired with the risks associated with a disease outbreak, make this an important, yet neglected, area of research.},

  abstract = {The need for electrical energy storage technologies (EEST) in a future energy system, based on volatile renewable energy sources is widely accepted. The still open question is which technology should be used, in particular in such applications where the implementation of different storage technologies would be possible. In this study, eight different EEST were analysed. The comparative life cycle assessment focused on the storage of electrical excess energy from a renewable energy power plant. The considered EEST were lead-acid, lithium-ion, sodium-sulphur, vanadium redox flow and stationary second-life batteries. In addition, two power-to-gas plants storing synthetic natural gas and hydrogen in the gas grid and a new underwater compressed air energy storage were analysed. The material footprint was determined by calculating the raw material input RMI and the total material requirement TMR and the carbon footprint by calculating the global warming impact GWI. All indicators were normalised per energy fed-out based on a unified energy fed-in. The results show that the second-life battery has the lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and material use, followed by the lithium-ion battery and the underwater compressed air energy storage. Therefore, these three technologies are preferred options compared to the remaining five technologies with respect to the underlying assumptions of the study. The production phase accounts for the highest share of GHG emissions and material use for nearly all EEST. The results of a sensitivity analysis show that lifetime and storage capacity have a comparable high influence on the footprints. The GHG emissions and the material use of the power-to-gas technologies, the vanadium redox flow battery as well as the underwater compressed air energy storage decline strongly with increased storage capacity.},

Irridescent shark was selected as aquaculture species. The biofilter consist of natural biomaterials such as coconut husk, coco peat, and coarse aggregates. The experiment was carried out for three short water recirculation durations of 2, 3, and 4 h/day. The influent and effluent ammonia NH3, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrites NO2 and nitrates NO3 levels were measured and analysed. The results showed that the biofilter effectively removed NH3 (65 - 71 \%), TAN (34 - 58 \%), and NO2 (60 - 67 \%) from the aquaculture water. The dissolved oxygen (DO) levels were maintained between 3 - 7.0 mg/l during all the recirculation durations. The significance of water recirculation period was assessed by calculating the differences between the means of water quality parameters with a statistical test named one-way analysis of variance (ANNOVA) with significant level P taken as 5 \%, i.e., P ≤ 0.5. The effluent mean NH3 levels 0.030 mg/l, 0.033 mg/l, and 0.022 mg/l exhibited significant difference at 4 h/d periods while effluent TAN levels 0.81, 0.77, and 0.77 showed no difference with varying periods.},

  abstract = {The availability of land and water for the cultivation process is limited, thus aquaponics cultivation technique is necessary to be considered. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of bio filter at different stocking densities and the effects on the growth of tilapia and pakchoy plants in aquaponic systems. This research was conducted at Romangpolong Village, Bontomarannu District, Gowa Regency, South Sulawesi, from August to October 2018. The study was conducted in the form of factorial experiment with two factors arranged according to a randomized block design. The first factor was the treatment of biofilter with bioball filter media which consisted of three levels: without bioball, 25 bioballs, 50 bioballs. The second factor was the density of fish stock consisting of two levels namely density of fish stocking with 6 fish per 50 L water per container and with 12 fish per 50 L water per container. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by the Least Significant Difference test at the level of 5\%. The results indicate that the interaction of 25 bioballs filter and the fish density of 6 fish per 50 L container produced the best water quality, thus can support the optimum metabolic process and producing the best growth and survival of fish reaching 100 \% and was able to supply the nutrient needs of pakchoy plants. The best results of growth and production of pakchoy shown were leaf area of 70.22 cm2 and fresh weight of 65.99 g/plant.},

These nutrients, which are excreted directly by aquatic organisms or generated by the microbial reactions on organic wastes are absorbed by the plants grown hydroponically. Using aquaponic systems has several advantages over recirculation systems in aquaculture and hydroponic systems that use inorganic nutrients. One of them is the utilization of wastes generated by the aquatic components, which are a problem in all production systems. Bearing in mind that Colombia has great potential for production of fish and plants, it is indispensable and necessary to promote projects that link the two production systems. Thus, the next review seeks to describe, in general terms, aquaponic recirculation systems.},

  abstract = {Chenopodium quinoa is a salt tolerant plant species of high nutritional value with potential to act as an extractive species under marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA). This study aimed to assess the growth per­ formance and antioxidant content and activity of C. quinoa cultivated in saline hydroponics under contrasting nitrogen concentrations mimicking different aquaculture effluents described in literature. Seedlings were culti­ vated under greenhouse conditions in a modified Hoagland solution with a salinity of 20 g l− 1 artificial sea salt and four nitrogen concentrations: 20 mg l− 1 (N20); 40 mg l− 1 (N40); 100 mg l− 1 (N100) and 200 mg l− 1 (N200). After 4 weeks, leaf chlorophyll content and biomass gain were determined. Total flavonoids, total phenols and contents of elements were analyzed in C. quinoa leaves and shoot tips. Antioxidant capacity was quantified using oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC). In treatments N100 and N200, C. quinoa presented higher biomass gain and lower antioxidant content and activity in its leaves and shoot tips. In contrast, in treatment N20 higher antioxidant content and activity were recorded, revealing the existence of stress inducing conditions during the experimental period. Shoot tips of these plants contained higher nitrogen and mineral contents than leaves. This approach may set the stage to develop a sustainable methodology to modulate the secondary metabolism of C. quinoa and enhance its value as functional food when cultured using marine aquaponics in IMTA systems.},

The aquaponic technology system has been done with 200 fishes m-3, water pump with 15 watts solar energy panel, physical and biological filter, and deep flow technique (DFT). In this study, we have reported that the specific growth rate (SGR), survival (SR), Feed conversion ratio (FCR), and Wet weight (W) are used as the physical growth indicator of Oreochromis niloticus fish, while the length and the number of leaves of plants are used as the physical growth indicator of plants. The physical growth of Oreochromis niloticus fish showed that SGR is 5,56\% day-1, SR is 97,67\%, FCR is 0,92g and the wet weight is 1220g. The physical growth of the plant in aquaponic technology systems has been compared with the hydroponic treatment systems as controls. Analysis with t-test shows that physical growth of Ipomoea Aquatica and Brassica rapa has no significant difference respectively, whereas Capsicum annuum has significant differences compared with controls. Also, Brassica rapa in the aquaponic technology system shows a more yellow leaf color than the control. Based on these results, we conclude that aquaponic technology system provides effective results for the physical growth of Oreochromis niloticus with Ipomoea Aquatica, while additional nutrients for the both Brassica rapa and Capsicum annuum are required.},

Activated carbon acts as absorbent, catalyst and filters in water purification, and is able to absorb anions, cations, and molecules of organic and inorganic compounds in the form of solution or gas. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of activated carbon thickness from organic waste on decreasing the toxicity of water in the aquaponics system. Water quality parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and ammonia content were measured at 20, 40 and 60 days after maintenance. The variation of treatments are P0 (as control), P1=1,5 cm activated carbon, P2=3 cm activated carbon, P3 = 4.5 cm activated carbon and P4=6 cm activated carbon. Based on the results of the study found that the use of activated carbon as medium and filter in an aquaponics system (rice-fish) can maintain water quality for 60 days of maintenance. The optimum water quality for the growth of fish and rice was in treatment P3 (4.5 cm thickness of activated carbon) and P4 (6 cm thickness of activated carbon). The thicker the activated carbon used, the more optimal the water quality.},

Combined production of fish and plants in recirculating water. Aquaculture, 10: 17-24. A pilot plant of ca 2000 1 of recirculating fresh water for intensive fish production was constructed in a controlled-environment greenhouse. The feasibility was examined of using nutrients from fiih waste-water, mainly oxidized nitrogenous compounds, for plant production , combined with an activated sludge system for water purification. The reduction of nitrates, formed during the extended aeration process by nitrifying bacteria, was not sufficient by higher plants and unicellular algae alone to reduce the nitrate concentration in our system significantly. An additional microbial denitrification step had to be included to effect maximal decrease in nitrogenous compounds. For fish culture in the pilot plant Tilapia mossambica and Cyprinus carpio were chosen as experimental fishes. Both fish species showed significant weight increases during the course of the experiment. Ice-lettuce and tomatoes were tested both in recirculating water and in batch culture. The unicellular algae Scenedesmus spp. were grown in a non-sterile batch culture. All plants grew well in the waste-water without additional nutrients. Determination of the physical and chemical parameters for optimum water purification, the most suitable ratio of denitrification by plants and by microorganisms, and the most favourable fish and plant species for combined culture in recirculating water are important and of current interest in view of the increasing demand for clean, fresh water, and the pressing need to find new ways of producing protein for human nutrition under prevailing conditions of an exponentially expanding world population.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of an aquaponics greenhouse cloud-based wireless monitoring system and control that allow plants and fish to co-exist in a synergetic and controlled ecology. Two controllers are designed based on threshold values for effective nitrification and mineralization processes, as well as to enhance the rate of photosynthesis. As compared to our previous work, Wi-Fi technology and cloud data storage are utilized instead of GSM to reduce the cost in monitoring and increase accessibility of the aquaponics greenhouse parameters to many users. Modification in the design of the solar energy conversion system is done with higher ratings on solar panels and batteries to ensure an uninterrupted power. The experimental data gathered during summer and winter days in an arid region show the performance of the designed aquaponics greenhouse system in promoting sustainability. Current developments in the design and implementation of an aquaponics greenhouse system as well as possible improvements for large-scale production set-up are also discussed in the paper.},

  abstract = {Recent organic pollution is caused primarily by the decay of blue-green algae, Microcystis aeruginosa, which is seriously multiplied due to phosphorus-based anthropogenic eutrophication. In eutrophic water, the phenomenon of pH rising in the surface water occurs due to photosynthesis by M. aeruginosa (rising over pH 10). Such pH value is enough to produce calcium phosphate precipitation. The M. aeruginosa cells form colonies and have the outer layer of which is surrounded by a gelatinous sheath. Thus, we considered simultaneous removal of phosphate ion and blue-green algae using calcium chloride from water surface of eutrophic pond. In the present chapter, a simultaneous removal method employing water chemical remediation (WCR) is described. In this method, a flow system was constructed by equipment of a calcium chloride injector and a sand filtration column. As a result, both calcium phosphate and agglutinated algae could be removed from the eutrophic pond water. These water nutrients are removed, phosphorus is concerned about exhaustion as a resource, and the collected algae can be used in various ways as biomass resources. Thus, our system showed the future ability to improve water quality, to remove contaminants, and to recover nutrients from eutrophic water.},

The Monte Carlo method was used to estimate its financial feasibility and the probability of the production volume and, consequently, evaluate the risk of this undertaking. The data analyzed included fixed and variable costs, revenues and financial viability indicators, which are net present value (NPV), periodic economic benefit (PEB) and internal rate of return (IRR). It was identified in this research that the cost with the largest participation was the land acquisition, amounting to more than 60\%. According to the survey, the venture showed a 56.69\% probability to generate a NPV, PEB and IRR rate, respectively, of R\$ 117,784.26, R\$ 16,003.11 and 37\%. The probability of occurrence of fish volume and plant production were, respectively, 1179.44 kg and 731.26 kg with 74.43\% and 76.16\%, presenting a probability greater than 50\%, which is considered as more reliable than traditional analysis. Therefore, we can conclude that it is economically viable according to the NPV parameters, which was greater than zero, and the IRR, that was higher than the minimum rate of attractiveness.},

  abstract = {The chemical composition of settleable faecal fish waste was determined from fresh manure samples collected at 12 commercial farms growing rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in Ontario, Canada. The manuresamples from the commercial farms averaged 2.83\% nitrogen (N), 2.54\% phosphorus (P), 0.10\% potassium (K), 6.99\% calcium (Ca), and 0.53\% magnesium (Mg) on a dry-weight basis. The concentrations of the metals, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) were also measured. Mean concentrations of these metals ranged from 0.05 mg/kg for Hg to 1,942 mg/kg for Fe. Fresh fish manure has similar levels of N, P, Ca, and Mg, and lower levels of K when compared to manure from beef, dairy cattle, poultry and swine. Fish manure tended to have a higher content of Mn, Cd, Cr, Pb, Fe, and Zn than most other livestock manures, but had lower levels of As, Se, Co, and Ni. The copper (Cu) content of fish manure was similar to all other livestock manures. The results from this study indicate that fresh fish manure is similar in its chemical composition to other livestock manures, and should be suitable for use as an agricultural fertilizer. In addition, it is hoped that these data will also help regulatory agencies and farmers make sensible and pragmatic pragmatic decisions concerning the appropriate and safe disposal of manure wastes collected from land-based trout culture facilities.},

However, the high demand of medicinal plants has also created huge business opportunities in commercial farming of medicinal plants. Largescale production of secondary metabolites by plants and medicinal materials will be crucial in the medicinal plant industry. As commercial cultivation of medicinal plants gains traction among farmers, N fertilizers will be increasingly used to enhance plant growth and yield. Therefore, the implementation of better nitrogen use efficiency is critically important. Excessive use of N can lead to many problems; it is costly, it can cause environmental pollution and its high levels in plant tissues can be toxic to plants, herbivores and humans. This chapter discusses the potential risks, opportunities and setbacks associated with the use of N in cultivation of medicinal plants.},

With a goal to work with local stakeholders, we have partnered with Sonder Farms in order to develop advertisements and classes aimed to raise awareness about, and interest in, sustainability. This partnership with Sonder Farms, a self-sustaining farm located in the Grand Rapids and Allendale communities, has given us the opportunity to put our skills, knowledge, and values to use in our local community. Sonder Farms practices conventional farming as well as aquaponics. Their hope is to target the community by countering issues such as environmental injustice, sustainable illiteracy, economics, education, health, and much more. They plan to offer classes to the community, covering subjects such as diet/nutrition, the environment, finances, sustainable agriculture and many more. Seeking to develop ideas of mutual benefit, we worked closely with Sonder Farms in order to cocreate and implement compelling and relevant action-plans. For instance, we have developed promotional materials illustrating the dimensions of sustainable illiteracy, highlighting Sonder Farms mission, and detailing the research we have conducted about downtown Grand Rapids residents. We have sought to make sustainability education accessible in the greater Grand Rapids area along four dimensions, including (1) posters (2) guerrilla advertisements, (3) the development of monthly newsletters, and (4) a plan for increasing the accessibility of Sonder Farm classes. The following describes our ultimate efforts, the process by which we came to this work, and the challenges we confronted. Through detailing our work, we hope to engage people who are enthusiastic about environmental justice, thereby increasing the chances these efforts will lead to systemic, long-term change.},

  abstract = {The present study examined the effects of three recirculation rates (50\%, 200\% and 400\%) on water quality and biomass growth at low and high fish stocking densities (122 and 220 fish/m3) in aquaponic systems. The system consisted of a Tilapia tank connected to a gravel filter and three hydroponic trenches in series with Ipomoea aquatica, Lactuca sativa and Canna glauca. The RRs influenced most water quality parameters with best water quality at the high RR. At the low RR of 50\% mass mortality of fish occurred due to lack of oxygen. The fish growth and survival was excellent in the high RR of 400\% at the low fish density of 122 fish/m3. The plant trenches were found to be effective in removing potential harmful concentrations of NH4-N and NO2-N from the recirculating water. For each kg of fish produced in this system approximately 1.0 m3 water was needed. During a 25-day period about 1 kg of marketable fresh biomass of I. aquatica and 270 g dry weight aboveground biomass of C. glauca was produced. It is concluded that high recirculation rate of the water of 200–400\% per day is needed to secure a good growth and a low FCR of Tilapia in aquaponic systems. High recirculation rates also secure a good water quality. The aquaponic system has a very low effluent discharge compared to traditional aquaculture techniques, and it recycles nutrients for plant growth. Hence, aquaponic system is a promising sustainable solution that can be applied on commercial fish pond scale.},

The WSN system consists of components: 02 wireless sensor nodes, 01 gateway, 01 cloud server and smartphone app. This WSN tested for data transmission in two zones: zone 1 (dense urban environments) at a distance of 500m and zone 2 (urban environments - less obstacles) at a distance of 1,500m and 1,700m. The data collected at different times of the day and updated every 15 minutes. The results show that the wireless sensor network system operates stably, data constantly updated to LoRa Server and there was not data packet loss. The power consumption of sensor node and gateway determined in three operating modes: transmitting, receiving, turn-off. This shows the advantages of LoRa technology in the development of wireless sensor network which is the distance of data transmission distance and low power consumption. Besides this WSN also tested in the net house of aquaponics of the Research Center for High-tech Application in Agriculture (RCHAA), University of Science, Vietnam National University-HCM. The results show that the WSN system is working reliably and promising which brings significantly benefits to smart agriculture as aquaponics, clean vegetable farms, aquaculture farms…},

  abstract = {This study was conducted to determine the effect of different stocking densities on growth rate of Asian swamp eel (Monopterus albus), growth of watercress (Nasturtium officinale) in a floating-draft aquaponic recirculating system. Two factorial experiment designs consist of three different swamp eel (16.67 ± 3.48 g/individual) densities of 100, 180 and 260 individuals/m2 (8.4, 15.0 and 21.7 kg/m3, respectively) integrated with hydroponic trough of watercress (SEW) or without watercress (swamp eel only, SE). Watercress seeds were put into styrofoam, floating rack (80 heads/m2). Swamp eels were fed 2 times per day with commercial pellet (42\% protein). The experiment was run for 65 days with two cycles of watercress. Statistical analysis by Two-way ANOVA showed that there is no significant difference (P \textbackslash textgreater.05) in growth performance of swamp eel at different stocking densities between the SEW and SE systems. However, statistical analysis by One way ANOVA showed that there is a significant difference (P \textbackslash textless.05) on weight gain (WG) and daily weight gain of animals among the SEW treatments. The highest WG was 32.78 ± 2.09 g/ind. and 41.71 ± 9.05 g/ind. for treatment of 180 inds./m2 at the SEW and SE, respectively. The average survival rate of animal in all treatments was above 80\% and was not significant difference among the treatments. The lowest FCR (2.15 ± 0.94) were found in treatment 180 inds./m2 of the SEW. Production of watercress was low in all treatments, the highest biomass (507.81 ± 91.01 g/m2) was recorded for treatment 180 inds./m2 of the SEW. Nutrient accumulation was relatively high at higher stocking densities of swamp eel and was higher in the SE system compared to the SEW system. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations in the SE treatments were ranging from 2.61 ± 1.81 mg/L (120 ind./m2) to 5.77 ± 3.19 mg/L (260 ind./m2). Whereas, the TAN levels in the SEW treatments were only ranging from 1.94 ± 1.44 to 5.35 ± 0.36 mg/L and even lower in hydroponic trough (1.3–3.15 mg/L). Similarly, nitrate‑nitrogen level was high in the SE treatments (1.43 ± 1.36–2.36 ± 1.43 mg/L) and lower in the SEW treatments (0.89 ± 1.36–1.42 ± 1.34 mg/L). Generally, swamp eel farming combined with hydroponic trough was feasible in handling water quality and required little water change in contrast to SE treatments which required as much as 1 water change a day. This study found that the stocking density of 180 inds./m2 seems to be the most effective density for growth, survival of swamp eel as well as nutrient accumulation in the SEW. The results of this study provide an important information as to how aquaculture of swamp eel may be expanded in the Mekong Delta without destroying the environment by releasing nutrient rich effluent from growing chambers.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the land-based production of fish in tanks combined with the recirculation of the water from the fish tanks through hydroponic systems to produce high value horticultural crops. The waste products from the fish are converted by a bio-filter into soluble nutrients, which are absorbed by the plants, and allow “clean” water to be returned back to the fish. Thus, it produces valuable fish protein with a minimal pollution of fresh water resources, while at the same time producing horticultural (usually vegetable) crops. The production of fertilizers is becoming increasingly expensive due to high prices on fossil fuels, and this may have long term implications for nutrient use in agriculture in the future. Aquaponics uses waste products derived from animals and plants which are fed to the fish, and thus converted into valuable animal protein and fresh vegetables. With the world’s fresh water resources limited, aquaponics would appear to have considerable potential for arid and similar climates. Disease and pest problems are minimized because of the development of an ecological balance. Productivity is commonly as good (or better) than with conventional hydroponic systems.},

On this stage a 400 liters aquarium was set up then populated with Goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) and Bronze Corydoras (Corydoras aeneus). During the time needed to set up the aquarium, basil, oregano and parsley seedlings were prepared aside. Upon completing this stage, the seedlings were moved into the grow bed and an aquaponic system was established. Thus, the NO3- rich water from the fish tank was directed to the grow bed. The working paper will present the steps to establish an ornamental aquarium, and how to turn it afterwards into a natural nutrients factory for a self-sustainable plant crop.},

  abstract = {Fish production in aquaculture is continuously increasing worldwide and the need for further increases is expected in the future. Aquaculture has several disadvantages considering environmental impact and water consumption, consequently aquaponic (AP) systems were proposed as one of the possible solutions for these issues. Although AP is an effective combination of vegetable and fish production, there is a mismatch between the nutrients provided by the fish compartment and the requirements of the plants. Once the system becomes limiting for the plant growth (usually P and/or K elements), the remaining N accumulates in the system water. Therefore it is necessary to replace periodically the system water. This work is focused on this specific phase: investigating the further utilization of the AP system water that is depleted of P and K, but still rich in N. This system water (FW) was used in a separate aquaponic mesocosm and compared with the same water supplemented with macro-nutrients (CFW) and with a hydroponic control (HC). Mizuna (M) and rocket salad (R) were used as short-cycle vegetables crops in a NFT system. Evapotranspiration in the system and water quality parameters were significantly influenced by the treatments. The starting N-NO3 concentration, similar in all systems, decreased by 31.2\% in FW, 72.0\% in HC and 82.7\% in CFW. SPAD, plant height and total yield highlighted the inability of FW to meet the nutritional needs of both species. The highest production was recorded for CFW followed by HC (-7.5\%) and FW (-74.7\%) probably due to the presence of organic compounds with biostimulant activity. Mizuna was able to absorb more nutrients, because of the production of a developed root system. FW must be integrated with macro- and mesonutrients in order to ensure a suitable production; the use of CFW for short-cycle vegetable cultivation is an effective solution to manage the fish water at the end of an AP cycle, achieving significant production, reducing nitrogen load and further reducing the environmental impact of the system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a recirculating technology that combines aquaculture with hydroponics. It allows nutrients from fish waste to feed plants and thus saves water and nutrients. However, there is a mismatch between the nutrients provided by the fish waste and plant needs. Because of this, some nutrients, notably N, tend to accumulate in the aquaponic water (APW or AP water). The aim of this study was to investigate how APW, which is depleted of P and K but still rich in N, could be further utilized. APW was used in a mesocosm and compared with APW from the same source that had been supplemented with macro-nutrients (complemented AP water or CAPW) and a hydroponic control (HC). Mizuna (M) and rocket salad (R) were used as short-cycle vegetable crops in a NFT system. The results revealed that the low production potential of APW was mainly caused by the lack of P and K. If these were supplemented, the yields were comparable to those in the HC. M yield in CAPW was significantly higher than that of HC, probably due to biostimulant effects connected to the organic components in the water as a result of fish farming. Water type, cultivation density, and intercropping significantly influenced the qualitative characteristics of the crop in terms of antioxidant compounds and minerals. Nitrate content in vegetables was lower than European regulation limits. The extended use of APW is viable if the missing nutrients are supplemented; this could be a strategy to increase the efficiency of water and nitrogen use, while further reducing environmental impact.},

  abstract = {NIHISER, BRICE A., M.S., May 2014, Environmental Studies Evaluation Of The Applications Of A Biomimetic Antifouling Surface (SharkletTM) Relative To Five Other Surfaces To Prevent Biofilm Growth In Freshwater Aquaponics Systems Director of thesis: Kelly S. Johnson Aquatic biofouling can be a problem issue in the aquaponics industry. The growing of both plants and fish in a linked system provides a unique challenge to growers due to high nutrient loads, which can lead to increased biofilm growth within a system. A new surface technology, named SharkletTM, uses small microscopic ridges to prevent marine biofouling. The surface, named due to its mimicry of shark skin, was designed because of a shark’s unique ability to not accrue marine organisms on its skin. SharkletTM technology was designed to alleviate the problem of aquatic biofouling on maritime ships, but due to cost constraints and user interest, may not be able to solve this issue in freshwater aquaponics systems. In this study, the ability of SharkletTM to retard biofilm growth in freshwater greenhouse mesocosms was compared to aluminum, fiberglass, plexiglass, PVC, and tile. SharkletTM performed well in high flow conditions, supporting less biofilm growth than tile and aluminum in non-flow conditions. However, in non-flow conditions it no significant differences were observed. In phone interviews, respondents from the aquaponics and hydroponics community felt that a material like SharkletTM would be easy enough to install, but had too high of a cost to be effective for the average aquaponics user.},

  abstract = {The landscape has been described as a ‘blind spot’ when examined in light of regional strategies. The immense potential of peri-urban and rural hinterlands to counter the climate emergency is therefore also overlooked. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT)Climate-KIC’s (Knowledge and Innovation Community) System and sustainable Approach to virTuous interaction of Urban and Rural LaNdscapes (SATURN) aims to address this short-sightedness. The reason why we do not see or value the landscape is complex, but part of the problem relates to its multiple ownership, numerous types and scales of conflicting designations, governance structures, policy requirements, and regulatory frameworks. This leads to an approach that is fragmented and sectoral and, therefore, fails to see the bigger picture or recognise the value that the territory has in order to deal with current environmental challenges. With partners from across Europe, the pan-European Orchestrated Ecosystem research project co-funded by EIT Climate-KIC, SATURN aims to develop new integrated strategies which will increase awareness of the capacity of the landscape, which is seen is seen as a vital way to address the deepening climate emergency. SATURN anticipates that the outputs will build capacity across Europe to help nation-states meet the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and respond to the environmental challenges. This paper, reporting on interim findings, sets out the next phase of the project and concludes with lessons learned so far, including an initial identification of processes that can be applied in regions across Europe and an evaluation of the significance of exchanging knowledge between different countries.},

  abstract = {In this work, an aquaponic cultivation system for Lactuca sativa (L.) and Chicorium intybus (L.) was compared to a hydroponic one, focusing on the main microbial populations related to food safety and their volatile compounds (VOCs), concluding with Spearman correlations among the microbes and VOCs. Different sections of both systems were sampled at the end of the commercial development of the plants. Plants cultivated in aquaponics were in general more contaminated than those from hydroponics, while for the cultivation waters a higher contamination of the hydroponics than aquaponics system was unexpectedly observed. Furthermore, the chicory exhibited higher levels of all microbial groups compared to lettuce grown under the same cultivation system. The results obtained also showed correlations between the distribution of some VOCs and microbial groups in the phyllosphere, while some examples of positive correlations between 2-nonanone (a positive phytostimulant compound) and anaerobic bacilli of the rhizosphere in lettuce were reported. So far, multivariate analysis of VOCs was able to discriminate on the basis of varieties but not on the cultivation systems. In conclusion, the microbial characteristics of the two ecosystems depended both on plant variety and cultivation method but further studies will need to deeply investigate the variables influencing the microbial quality of vegetable foods obtained by aquaponics. On the other hand, the analysis of the VOCs was more related to the microbial community of each plant variety considered, whatever the cultivation system. In precision agriculture, metabolomics may represent an opportunity to study the holobiome and through it the interactions between plants and their microbial populations, to possibly provide for a tool to assess the microbiological quality of vegetable foods obtained by aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {Crop production in open fields is increasingly limited by weather extremes and water shortages, in addition to pests and soil-borne diseases. In order to increase crop yield, quality, and productivity, controlled environment agriculture (CEA) can play an important role as an alternative and supplemental production system to conventional open field production. CEA is any agricultural technology that enables growers to manipulate the growing environment for improved yield and quality. CEA production systems include high tunnels, greenhouses, and indoor vertical farming, as well as hydroponics and aquaponics. Currently, ‘low-tech’ CEA techniques such as high tunnels (plastic greenhouses with minimum or no cooling and heating) are primarily utilized in developing countries where labor costs are relatively low, and China has by far the largest area covered by high tunnels or ‘Chinese-style’ solar greenhouses. The most control-intensive ‘high-tech’ CEA approach, namely indoor vertical farming, has gained tremendous attention in the past decade by researchers and entrepreneurs around the world, owing to advancements in lighting technology, including use of light emitting diodes (LEDs), and increasing urbanization with new market opportunities. This special issue covers some of the CEA topics such as LED lighting, substrate, and hydroponics.},

It needs adequate oxygen and proper pH to make nitrification bacteria alive to convert NH3 to NO3- and NO2. Therefore, a system which controls oxygen and pH is needed. For pH calibration, a curve fitting method was used to get an accurate measurement. For oxygen calibration, saturated dissolved oxygen water was used. It was obtained using a Potentiometric method. Moreover, Simple Moving Average was used to get a stable reading.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to exploit the euryhaline nature of commercially attractive species for their cultivation in freshwater aquaponic systems. This approach may increase the profitability of aquaponic production in coastal countries where the consumption of marine fish is traditional and of commercial relevance. For this purpose, juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were reared in an aquaponic freshwater (AFW) system and an aquaponic saltwater (ASW) system (salinity 20 ppt), in combination with chard (Beta vulgaris var. cicla) seedlings, a salt tolerant plant. At the end of the trial, nitrate and phosphate concentration in water significantly increased in the ASW system, suggesting that the ability of B. vulgaris to absorb these substances was limited by salinity. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry revealed that the concentration of some oligoelements such as Fe remained lower with respect to the concentration in the freshwater hydroponic solution, in both AFW and ASW. FTIR-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on plants showed that growth at high salinity affected their lipid content. In the case of fish, freshwater had no effects on mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acid profiles, although saturated fatty acids were significantly decreased in D. labrax reared in AFW. Our results demonstrates that it is possible to increase aquaponic profitability by farming D. labrax juveniles in an aquaponic freshwater system together with Beta vulgaris, obtaining good quality products.},

To determine the required level of supplementation, three identical aquaponic systems (A, B, and C) and one hydroponic system (D) were stocked with lettuce, mint, and mushroom herbs. The aquaponic systems were stocked with Nile tilapia. System A only received nutrients derived from fish feed; system B received nutrients from fish feed as well as weekly supplements of micronutrients and Fe; system C received the same nutrients as B, with weekly supplements of the macronutrients, P and K; in system D, a hydroponic inorganic solution containing N, Ca, and the same nutrients as system C was added weekly. Lettuce achieved the highest yields in system C, mint in system B, and mushroom herb in systems A and B. The present study demonstrated that the nutritional requirements of the mint and mushroom herb make them suitable for aquaponic farming because they require low levels of supplement addition, and hence little management effort, resulting in minimal cost increases. While the addition of supplements accelerated the lettuce growth (Systems B, C), and even surpassed the growth in hydroponic (System C vs. D), the nutritional quality (polyphenols, nitrate content) was better without supplementation.},

The growth of Gotukola (Centella asiatica (L.))—a leafy vegetable as well as traditional medicinal plant—and koi carp (Cyprinus carpio var. koi.)—a high demand ornamental fish—were evaluated at three different HLRs, viz. 2.6 m day−1 (T1), 7.8 m day−1 (T2), and 13.0 m day−1 (T3). Treated aquaculture wastewater was utilized in a combination of the freshwater in 1:1 ratio with 2.1 kg m−3 fish stocking density. The highest fish mean length; weight; feed conversion ratio; specific growth rate; NH3, NO2−, and NO3− removal percentage; and plant growth parameters were observed. Considering fish (koi carp) and plants (Gotukola) growth parameters as well as nutrient removal percentages, a HLR of 7.8 m day−1 was found to be the optimum in aquaponics.},

The control 2 (C2); plant grown in field condition was assigned to compare the efficiency with aquaponics. The highest length (10.79 ± 0.24 cm) and weight gain (12.53 ± 0.19 g) in fish were observed in T1 and the highest nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) activity of the fish was found in T1. However, the highest catalase activity, glucose, and cortisol level were obtained in (T3), which concluded that the fish growth was significantly affected by the highest stocking density. However; the medium stocking density (T2) didn't show a significant difference with the lowest stocking density (T1). In contrast to the biomass of koi carp, the yield of C. asiatica increased significantly with fish stocking density. The highest yield (203.76 ± 11.03 g) was obtained by the maximum stocking density (T3) but it was not significantly different from T2. Considering the water quality parameters, nutrient dynamics, plant growth as well as fish health monitoring parameters, the stocking density of 2.1 kg m−3 (T2) could be suggested as the optimum stocking density for this system.},

  abstract = {Meeting agricultural policy and statistical goals requires a definition of U.S. agriculture’s basic unit, the farm. However, these goals can be at odds with one another. USDA defines “farm” very broadly to comprehensively measure agricultural activity. Consequently, most establishments classified as farms in the United States produce very little, while most production occurs on a small number of much larger operations. While desirable for obtaining comprehensive national coverage, measurement and analysis based on the current definition can provide misleading characterizations of farms and farm structure in the United States. Additionally, more stringent requirements have been proposed for farms to qualify for Federal agricultural program benefits. This analysis outlines the structure of U.S. farms, discusses the current farm definition, evaluates several potential criteria that have been proposed to define target farms more precisely, and examines how these criteria affect both statistical coverage and program eligibility.},

The impacts of the waste generated by the fish on the water quality, the filtration capability of the herbs and the ability of fish and herbs to retain nutrients (NPK) were also estimated. All the herbs showed water purifying potentials to varying degrees as significantly lower levels of nitrogenous compounds (NH3-N, NO3-N, NO2-N) were observed after the herbal filtration. The plant growth seemed to be affected by their ability to absorb nutrients and consequently purify the culture medium. Interestingly, the lemon fin barb hybrid also showed significant differences in terms of weight gain, but the nutrient retention among fish treatments was not statistically different. The plants absorbed less phosphorus and potassium than the fish. After computing for the total system percentage of NPK recovered, nitrogen was the most retained nutrient. The peppermint showed superiority in terms of gross biomass and water purifying potential compared to the Chinese celery and coriander.},

Aquaponics combines hydroponic production of plants and aquaculture production of fish into a sustainable agriculture system that uses natural biological cycles to supply nitrogen and minimizes the use of nonrenewable resources, thus providing economic benefits that can increase over time. Critical management requirements (water quality maintenance and biofilter nitrification) for aquaculture need to be integrated with hydroponics to successfully manage intensive aquaponic systems. These systems will be discussed with emphasis on improving sustainability through management and integration of the living components plants, bacteria and biofilter system. Challenges to sustainability center around balancing aquaponic system environment for optimum growth of three organisms, maximizing production outputs and minimizing effluent discharges to environment. Opportunities to sustainable include biological nitrogen production rates. The potential to fill the gap between research and implementation of commercial aquaponic systems have been identified.},

There is expanding interest in aquaponics as a form of aquaculture that can be used to produce food closer to urban centers. Commercial aquaponics uses methods and equipment from both the hydroponics and aquaculture industries. There have been few studies of commercial-scale aquaponics production. Traditional farming contributes to household food security by providing direct access to food that can be harvested, prepared and fed to family members, often on a daily basis. Even very poor, landless or near landless people practise gardening on small patches of homestead land, vacant lots, roadsides or edges of a field, or in containers. Traditional farming may be done with virtually no economic resources, using locally available planting materials, green manures, " live " fencing and indigenous methods of pest control. Our survey findings provide a better understanding of the business of aquaponics, which may enhance future commercial operations.},

Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the performance of a catfish–pumpkin aquaponics system in comparison with recirculatory and static aquaculture systems (for fish performance), as well as irrigated and nonirrigated systems (for pumpkin performance). Results obtained showed that the production of fish in the aquaponics system was 29\% and 75\% more efficient than recirculatory and static aquaculture systems, respectively. The survival of the fish was also significantly improved probably due to better water quality in the aquaponics system. With respect to pumpkin production, yield in the aquaponics system was about five times the performance in irrigated land and eleven times those in nonirrigated land. This study gives definitive evidence to support the efficiency of the aquaponics system over other conventional food production methods.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics production of fish and plant is one of the environmentally sustainable farming methods of the twenty-first century. In this study, two agricultural wastes (Palm kernel shells aka PKS and Periwinkle shells aka PWS) were evaluated for their suitability as growth beds in the propagation of pumpkin Telfairia occidentalis. In addition, conventionally used gravel and its mixture with PKS and PWS (33.33\% each) were also tested. The resultant effects of these treatments on water quality of the system were reported. The result obtained reveals better performance of pumpkin in the PKS and PWS medias in terms of vine length, leave area, leave number, branch number and bi-weekly plant yield. The least performance was observed in the plants propagated in the gravel substrate. Water quality and percentage nitrogenous compound reduction (NH3, NO2 and NO3) across the system and in the different grow beds suggests that mixing all substrate resulted in better water qualities for fish and plant growth. Aside the superior growth observed in this study, alternative uses of these agricultural by-products in aquaponics system is highly recommended because of the possibility of converting waste to wealth.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The intensification of marine aquaculture raises multiple sustainability issues, namely the handling of nutrient-rich effluents that can adversely impact ecosystems. As integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) gains momentum, the use of halophyte plants to phytoremediate aquaculture effluents has received growing attention, particularly in aquaponics. It is, therefore, important to obtain a more in-depth knowledge of the microbial communities present in the root systems of these plants, both in their natural environment (sediment) and in aquaponics, in order to understand their nutrient removal potential. The present study used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and barcoded pyrosequencing to assess the bacterial community present in the endosphere and rhizosphere of three halophyte plants:               Halimione portulacoides               ,               Salicornia ramosissima               and               Sarcocornia perennis               . Species-specific effects were recorded in the profile and diversity of the bacterial communities present in halophyte roots, with significant differences also recorded for the same halophyte species grown in contrasting environments (sediment               vs               . aquaponics). In aquaponics the most abundant groups belonged to the orders               Rhodocyclales               ,               Campylobacterales               ,               Rhodobacterales               and               Desulfobacterales               , while in the natural environment (sediment) the most abundant groups belonged to the orders               Rhizobiales               ,               Sphingomonadales               and               Alteromonadales               . An overall enrichment in bacterial taxa involved in nutrient cycling was recorded in the roots of halophytes grown in aquaponics (such as               Denitromonas               ,               Mesorhizobium               ,               Colwellia               ,               Dokdonella               and               Arcobacter               ), thereby highlighting their potential to reduce the nutrient loads from aquaculture effluents.},

  abstract = {To date, most aquaponic research has been conducted outdoors in tropical climates or in greenhouses in subtropical climates. For more northerly latitudes, aquaponic production will require supplemental light in greenhouses or insulated buildings. Two separate 3-wk growth trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of four different lighting technologies on the growth of Swiss chard, Beta vulgaris (Trial 1) and kale, Brassica oleracea (Trial 2) in aquaponic systems. Light technologies evaluated included fluorescent (FLO), metal halide (MH), induction (IND), and light-emitting diode (LED). Four 1175-L systems were used with all four light types represented in each system in a complete block design. Juvenile Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (241 g) were stocked in each system and fed a floating 32\% protein diet at a rate of 60 g/m2 of plant grow space per day. In Trial 1, Swiss chard plants grown under LED lights for 3 wk achieved significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) average individual weights (117.7 g), higher production per unit of area (3535 g/m2), and higher production per unit of energy (32.3 g/m2/kwh) than Swiss chard grown under the other three light types, which did not differ significantly (P {$>$} 0.05) from each other. In Trial 2, kale grown under LED lights achieved significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) average individual weights (102.9 g), higher production per unit of area (2136.6 g/m), and higher production per unit of energy (381.5 g/m2/kwh) than kale grown under the other three light types, which did not differ significantly (P {$>$} 0.05). The results of the two trials are in agreement and indicate that LED lights were superior to MH, FLO, and IND lights in terms of absolute plant growth as well as growth per unit of energy consumed.},

Although Malaysia is recognized as a developed country, poverty is still occurring among Malaysian, especially from rural area. Therefore, aquaponic – a modern farming system is being introduced to benefit the low income family. Aquaponic is the term that described the synergistic combination of aquaculture and hydroponic farming. Aquaponic system is comprised of two units, which is fish culture tank and plant growing area. This integrated system makes use of the rich nutrient wastes from cultured fish to cater the plant growth and in turn, the plant plays an important role to cleanse and re-oxygenate the water to be reused for the fish culture. A feasibility study to produce catfish and lettuce by aquaponic system has been carried out in involving 10 participants and the result has been found to be satisfying.},

This work aims to (i) identify process technologies and technical measures which would enhance the profitability of aquaponics business while conserving energy and other resources, and (ii) to validate the determined optimal measures on the testing aquaponics farm. The process network synthesis technique was used to search for an optimal process pathway while the image processing technique was applied to automatically monitor the growth rate of produce since it is the main revenue stream in aquaponics. With the aid of P-graph method, the optimal feasible structure has 9 times higher annual net income than that of the existing process. This optimal solution includes the integration of electrical heat pump, biogas system, and utilizes black solider fly (BSF) facility to produce fish feed. Additional light energy savings were achieved by practical installation of reflective foils which improved 16.88\% of Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) on growth beds. These measures can help the aquaponics farms to become more competitive and to decrease their ecological footprint.},

The need for energy and its related services to satisfy human social and economic development, welfare and health is increasing. Returning to renewables to help mitigate climate change is an excellent approach which needs to be sustainable in order to meet energy demand of future generations. The study reviewed the opportunities associated with renewable energy sources which includes: Energy Security, Energy Access, Social and Economic development, Climate Change Mitigation, and reduction of environmental and health impacts. Despite these opportunities, there are challenges that hinder the sustainability of renewable energy sources towards climate change mitigation. These challenges include Market failures, lack of information, access to raw materials for future renewable resource deployment, and our daily carbon footprint. The study suggested some measures and policy recommendations which when considered would help achieve the goal of renewable energy thus to reduce emissions, mitigate climate change and provide a clean environment as well as clean energy for all and future generations.},

Techno- economic analysis (TEA) and Life-cycle assessment (LCA) were tools for the analysis. In this study, the cost  assessment and environmental assessment will be analyzed for the production of fish meal diet (0.01ton per  diet); using a single screw extruder at three different scenarios (10ton/y, 100ton/y, 1000ton/y), The key results  for this study and trial will be presented and discussed. Aquatic feed producers can use this tool to evaluate their  annual cost, energy consumption and emissions.},

  abstract = {Fish excretions and the transformation of nitrogen by bacteria in the nitrifying biofilter are two of the main sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in fish farms that use recirculating water systems. In this study, the DIN concentration in an experimental Dicentrarchus labrax aquaculture system was calculated using empirical sub-models for fish growth, ingested food and water replacement. The specific growth rate (SGR) (\% day−1) and the daily feeding rate (DFR) (\% day−1) both depend on the average weight, W (g), of the fish: Y=aWb, where Y may be SGR or DFR, and a and b are empirical constants. The DIN discharge rate, ΓN (\% of ingested nitrogen), in the experimental aquaculture system was expressed as a function of increasing replacement water flow rate, θ (day−1): DIN=cθd, where c and d are empirical constants. Only three variables (the number of fish, the initial fish weight and the replacement water flow rate) are required to run the general model, which was tested over a period of 12 months (June 1997–June 1998). This model, calibrated and validated on independent sets of data obtained from the same experimental system, accurately predicted the concentration of DIN in the effluent (r2=0.92).},

  abstract = {To obtain a greater amount of food by increasing the land yield, it is a common farming practice to apply fertilisers, the selection and cost of which are subject to intensive research. This study presents a new software application named “Optifer”, which permits the calculation of the least expensive combination of fertilisers to obtain the desired nutrient solution for fertigation, efficient fertiliser management and time and money savings. The software includes a fertiliser database, which allows the parameters to be verified and modified. The use of the application is notably simple. After a few basic steps, such as inputting the composition of the irrigation water to be used, choosing the fertilisers available to the farmer and entering the nutrient solution sought, the software calculates the quantity of each fertiliser that must be added to the fertiliser tanks, considering balance percentages, irrigation water flow rates, spray rates and tank capacities. Additionally, the user has the option of saving a historical record of the data used and the results of the processes.},

The technical complexity increases with the scale of production and required water treatment, e.g. filtration, UV light for microbial control, automatic controlled feeding, computerization and biosecurity. Upscaling is realized through multiunit systems that allow staggered fish production, parallel cultivation of different plants and application of several hydroponic subsystems. The main task of coupled aquaponics is the purification of aquaculture process water through integration of plants which add economic benefits when selecting suitable species like herbs, medicinal plants or ornamentals. Thus, coupled aquaponics with closed water recirculation systems has a particular role to fulfil.},

The concentrations of the dissolved macronutrients Total Ammonia Nitrogen (TAN, as NH4+N), nitrite (NO2−-N), nitrate (NO3−-N), Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN), Total Oxidized Nitrogen (TON), phosphorus (measured as ortho-phosphate) (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were monitored with colorimetric analyses and budgeted for potential use for aquaponics. We found, that stocking density and RAS maintenance affected oxygen thresholds, subsequently affecting nutrient concentrations of NO3−-N due to denitrification. K proportionally increased with feed input, while Ca, Mg and P reacted disproportionally, because of precipitation. Highest deviation was observed for TON, especially when oxygen levels dropped {$<$} 6 mg L−1. Maintenance intervals, feed ratios and resulting oxygen levels changed dissolved nutrient concentrations, with highest concentrations under intensive stocking density, medium feed input and oxygen {$>$} 6 mg L−1, and lowest under semi-intensive stocking density, high feed input and oxygen {$>$} 6 mg L−1. Calculated nutrient budgets under consideration of stocking density, feed input and water exchange rates demonstrated that the production conditions affected nutrient availability and output. The macronutrient ratios TDN, P, K, Ca and Mg as well as the physical and chemical parameters changed constantly under production conditions, due to daily adjusted feeding and RAS maintenance. This must be considered during process management, in stand-alone commercial catfish aquaculture as well as in integrated systems such as aquaponics.},

Each system contained 3.7 m3 water, and the relationship of the water volume in the aquaculture tank to the settling basin (sedimenter), the biofilter and the hydroponic units was 2.25:1:0.075:0.6 (fish tank:hydroponic unit = 3.75), with a daily water input of 5.77\% (±0.20) and a water removal rate of 1.37\% (±0.04) per day. The experiment was divided into three sub-experiments (49 days SE I, 56 days SE II, 55 days SE III), characterized by increasing mean (24.85 g (±0.36)) and total (1,217.50 g (±17.68)) feed input levels in SE I, 131.12 g (± 4.99) and 7,342.50 g (±279.31) in SE II, and 221.72 g (±8.78) and 11,751.00 g (±465.28) in SE III, respectively. Sub-experiment I was the run-in phase, characterized by low nutrient loads, fish and plant weights. This phase showed increasing values of oxygen, phosphate, salinity and conductivity. SE II was the exponential phase, with increasing feed input, fish and plant weights, until a distinct drop in oxygen levels occurred, and increasing conductivity, salinity and nutrient loads. SE III was the steady phase, where the feed input of 200 g day-1 balanced the oxygen level, salinity, conductivity and nutrient load, with a water input of 6.53\% (±0.02) and a lower removal rate of 1.23\% (±0.00) per day. Nile tilapia fry (Oreochromis niloticus) of 0.50 g initial weight resulted in an individual fish weight gain of 60.93 g (±28.95), a specific growth ratio (SGR) of 3.04\% d-1 (±0.34), 24.25 kg of biomass weight gain and a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 0.83 in system I, and a non-significant weight gain (p {$<$} 0.05) of 51.29 g (±16.20), an SGR of 2.98\% d-1 (±0.21), 20.42 kg of biomass weight gain and an FCR of 0.93 in system II. The overall yield of tomato biomass was 20.03 kg. In this communication, we describe our experimental ebb-flow aquaponic system to demonstrate the influence of system design on the chemophysical parameters, system stability, and fish and plant growth. The importance of other, as yet untested, parameters that may influence economic sustainability, e.g. feed design, fish welfare, parasite and pathogen control, fish physiology, fish/plant combinations and product quality, are discussed.},

Each system contained 3.7 m3 water, and the relationship of the water volume in the aquaculture tank to the settling basin (sedimenter, clarifier), the biofilter and the hydroponic units was 2.25:1:0.075:0.6 (fish tank:hydroponic unit = 3.75). The hydroponics were built as gravel bed aggregate systems with a single nutrient enriched water inlet for each of four plant units, and a horizontal sub-irrigation towards the outlet. Related to an increasing feed input into the fish tanks, DO levels in the hydroponic units were lowest inside the system (1-4.7 mg L-1). This is a favourable place for oxygen level monitoring to indicate a stable performance. Declining DO trends were observed in both cycles, with significant differences (p {$<$} 0.05) within cycle I and II on 4 consecutive days. Oxygen means of cycle I and II were significant only on day I. Inside the 2 m2 plant boxes, slightly decreasing trends in DO distribution towards the outlet were observed. Time series of all four experimental days (ANOVA, p {$<$} 0.05) showed varying values of phosphorus with highest levels on sampling day III in both cycles. Following an increase in feed input, a sluggish phosphorus accumulation inside the plant boxes was observed. Parallel arrangement of the 4 plant boxes in each cycle had no influence onto water parameters within each plant box. Within each cycle no trend was observed, total parameter values differed only slightly, influenced by the system design of the hydroponic units. Plant growth was different in cycle I and II. Best growth was recorded close to the nutrient enriched water inlet into the plant boxes, assessing the chosen central nutrient water irrigation system as sub-optimal for plant growth. Cucumber and zucchini showed better biomass gain (sum 7.60 kg) in plant box II of cycle II than in other plant boxes, suggesting variable conditions inside the plant boxes of the tested aquaponic system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics, or the co-culture of fish and plants, has been widely regarded as a solution to the growing food requirement of an increasingly urban landscape. However, difficulties in scaling up arise particularly for start-up growers due to the lack of reliable models to describe the nutrient balance in an aquaponics set-up. In this study, a comprehensive model for the products of the nitrogen cycle is presented in a constant-head one pump (CHOP) aquaponics assembly in order to have a picture of their concentrations in the system, thereby eliminating expensive trial and error adjustments. The growth rate and rate of waste generation of Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) was mathematically represented alongside the growth rate and rate of nitrogen assimilation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The evolution of nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter was also modelled. The condition of high recirculation rates was assumed to eliminate the spatial variation of concentration in smallvolume modular tanks. The results of the simulation suggest that a linear propagation of both fish and plant through time will result to a deficiency of nutrients for the plants in the beginning of the fish growing cycle, and an excess of nitrates towards the end. To manage rising nitrate levels, the adoption of a staggered growing system was suggested instead of changing water. Overall, the developed model performed satisfactorily in providing a reference to the grower, and is hoped to be extended to other nutrients as well in the future.},

  abstract = {The high rate of African catfish (Clarias sp.) consumption makes aquaponics system to be an alternative in overcoming the limitations of cultivated land. The decrease in water quality is caused by fish’s excretion which can influence fish’s life. Aquaponics system is considered able to improve this catfish growth process. This study analyzes the influence of water spinach (Ipomoea aquatic) density on the survival and growth rate of African catfish in an aquaponics system. This study involved 672 African catfish which were then divided randomly into four different groups, namely P0 (without any water spinach in the aquarium), P1 (20 pieces water spinach), P2 (30 pieces water spinach), and P3 (40 pieces water spinach). The amount of fish and its weight were measured, along with water spinach density and water quality (pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and ammonia levels). The survival rate of the African catfish observed from group P0, P1, P2, and P3 were 26.7; 75.59; 80.95; and 88.69\% respectively (p {$<$} 0.05). The specific growth rate were 0.79; 1.00; 1.12; and 1.15\%, respectively (p {$<$} 0.05). Water spinach based aquaponics can optimize survival and growth rate of African catfish. These findings support the ongoing aquaponic system which is considered quite easy with water spinach. This study suggests further research on the optimal ratio of African catfish and spinach plants that are more specific.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics (AP) is an integrated multi-trophic system that combines elements of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) and hydroponics (HP). In AP systems, waste streams from the RAS, rich in nutrients, are reused to grow plants hydroponically. Fish sludge (the solid fraction of the waste stream) contains a major part of these nutrients (i.e. the macro and microelements and especially P) and these are discharged from the AP system in some system designs. To increase the reuse of nutrients in AP systems, processes of recovery, such as the transfer of nutrients from the solid to the soluble phase (i.e. cations, anions, and chelates), should be developed. In this study, we investigated the nutrient mineralisation performance (NMP) of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) sludge aerobically treated in a long-term experiment (121 days) and in a short-term experiment (15 days) with artificially lowered pH (pH 6.3). Mass balance equations were used to determine and compare the NMP between experiments. NMP showed a macronutrient recovery (i.e. nutrient passing from the solid phase to the soluble phase) between 0 and 40\%, while the NMP of micronutrients was 2\%. In the long-term experiment, P had a negative value (− 1\%) indicating that its soluble forms were lowered due to wash out and precipitation or were assimilated by the microorganisms. In the short-term experiment, a quick drop in pH had an almost immediate (1 day) increasing effect on P, K, and Ca solubility while N and Mg were better mineralised in the long-term experiment. Our study demonstrated that a low pH step is an efficient way to improve the nutrient recovery from aerobically treated sludge.},

An assessment of crop productivity was also carried out to outline differences in productive traits of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. ‘Verde degli Ortolani’) grown in sterilized and non-sterilized aquaponic systems against a hydroponics floating system supplied with a nutrient solution of 1.6 dS cm-1. Total coliforms under UV disinfection showed counts well below 1 CFU ml-1 and a reduction in microbial loads higher than 99\%. Furthermore no Escherichia coli were found in both sterilized and non-sterilized aquaponic systems. No significant differences were recorded for productive traits of lettuce (yield, mean shoot weight, shoot and root dry biomass, leaf area, specific leaf dry weight), suggesting that aquaponics is a valid method to produce vegetables with high hygienic standards.},

Aquaponics is an environmental-friendly production system due to its full reuse of waste and nutrients. The research, carried out at the Experimental Farm of the University of Tuscia, compared summer yields of two romaine lettuce crops (Lactuca sativa L. ‘Integral’) grown on aquaponic and hydroponic floating systems. For the hydroponic treatment a nutritive solution of 1.7 dS m-1 and pH 5.5 supported plant growth. For the aquaponic system two treatments under different fish densities supplied nutrients at different concentrations. Every aquaponic treatment consisted of 3 independent 250-L tanks stocked with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.). Each fish tank fed a 1.5 m2 floating system under a 20 plant m-2 density. For the first crop 110 g and 24 g tilapia were stocked at system setup respectively under a low (5 kg m-3) and high (8 kg m-3) density and supplied nutrients with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.4 and 0.6 dS m-1. For the second crop 168 g and 90 g tilapia respectively stocked under a low (6 kg m-3) and high (20 kg m-3) stocking density raised EC levels to 0.5 and 1.0 dS m-1. Production of 2.8 kg m-2 from the first hydroponic crop was similar to the 2.7 kg m-2 assessed in the high density aquaponic treatment. Conversely the 2.3 kg m-2 measured in the low density treatment was smaller. For the second trial no differences were noticed between the 6.0 kg m-2 measured in the hydroponic system and the 5.7 and 5.6 kg m-2 assessed in the high and low-density aquaponic treatments, respectively. Nevertheless different nutrient concentrations in water affected plant mineral composition. Aquaponic leaves were poorer in phosphorus but richer in calcium, potassium magnesium and sodium.},

  abstract = {Defence Institute of Bio-Energy Research, Haldwani has successfully developed a hydroponics system by clubbing the soil less cultivation with rain water harvesting technology. The institute has also developed a suitable nutrient composition suitable for wide range of vegetables. Among the various varieties/hybrids grown in hydroponics, cucumber line PC 4C-8 exhibited the maximum fruit yield (448.3 q/ha). Among the various tomato hybrids, Avinash-2 exhibited highest yield (1052 q/ha) and number of fruits (154 per sq m) whereas TSS, total sugars, crude protein and minerals content were the maximum in tomato hybrid DARL-304. Interestingly, hydroponics system prolonged the harvesting period by 45 days in tomato. Plant population density of 6 plants/m2 was found optimum with the highest fruit yield in tomato and cucumber. Tomato hybrid DARL-304 exhibited higher fruit yield (6.5 kg/plant). Hydroponics system have been found successful in Auli (9000’ MSL), Joshimath with fruit yield of 2.25 kg/plant to 3.79 kg/plant in tomato. The yield was higher in rain water as comparison to river water. The article deals with the hydroponics technology in detail vis-à-vis efforts made at DIBER for standardization of hydroponics technology. It is envisaged that experience gained in successful cultivation of various crops in hydroponics using single nutrient solution at various altitudes through research stations of the institute.},

Here, we make a step towards using of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for the optimization of fish tanks. The proposed CFD based methodology allows the modeler (the designer) to manipulate both the tank geometry and operating conditions, in order to solve a multicriteria optimization problem. The individual objective functions are quantifying multiple criteria, dealing mainly with the rearing conditions for fish (a determined average velocity and low velocity variance), fast biosolids removal and the cost of energy and place. As an example of our methodology, we present a study involving the CFD analysis of four different RAS: (i) the circular, (ii) the octagonal, (iii) the square, and (iv) the rectangular multivortex RAS, either with or without additional plate baffles between two water inlets. Based on the two-dimensional description of the flow field within each RAS configuration, the set of efficient solutions for RAS is inferred.},

  abstract = {Fish farming prospects depend on the type of production system and the level of management. Therefore, the level of fish homeostasis and stress are important factors during their rearing period. Fish receive environmental stimuli mainly by their body receptors and react to them by an infinite number of outcomes influenced by various neurohormonal-biochemical processes. Using Recirculating Water Systems (RWSs), a notable reduction of undesirable hormonal and metabolic-biochemical functions could be easily achieved by preserving a proper combination of rearing water characteristics with tank size, fish rearing density, feeding practice and fish living ethology demands. These results could be further enhanced by combining the above mentioned parameters with rearing tank color and certain lighting conditions (photoperiod, spectrum, intensity). Also, by transmission of classical music into the fish rearing tanks, RWS facilities and proper rearing management can considerably contribute towards enhancing most fish anti-stress neurohormonal functions. That means that fish can feel closer to the way they should by living in their natural environment, without, however, facing its difficulties (e.g. enemies, water pollution, climate change). So, RWSs can provide for fish an excellent artificial “natural” living environment, while their construction and operation costs could be remarkably reduced not only by their low water requirements but also by using proper material, renewable energy resources and integration with aquaponics practices. Under these rearing conditions fish, being almost “happy”, can show the highest possible levels of growth rate, final product quality and welfare, ensuring the farmers and consumers satisfaction as well.},

  abstract = {De las actividades acuícolas, la producción en estanques tiene una gran importancia en los países como Brasil, Colombia y Venezuela, entre otros, en donde las cifras de producción presentan un panorama de crecimiento acelerado. La piscicultura, por ejemplo, tiene un enorme potencial debido a las óptimas condiciones de nuestros países en cuanto a hidrología, topografía y edafología, y por la riqueza en especies ícticas con cualidades para cultivo. Así, la piscicultura se torna una actividad agropecuaria autóctona y ventajosa. Trabajar con riquezas naturales propias permite ventajas competitivas, minimizando costos, y reduciendo necesidades de importar insumos y tecnología, entre otras. Observamos que otras actividades agropecuarias se sustentan en especies importadas y adaptadas a las más adversas condiciones, como ejemplo, el ganado europeo, el arroz chino, etc. Sin embargo, se debe reconocer que desarrollar tecnologías de producción obliga a considerar aspectos ambientales que garanticen su permanencia en el tiempo, con beneficios sociales, económicos, etc. La acuicultura como cualquier actividad genera impacto, empezando porque se desarrolla en ecosistemas artificiales diferentes a los naturales, y afectando los recursos hídricos por la cantidad de efluentes ricos en materia orgánica, que son vertidos sin siquiera saber lo que está siendo lanzado. Este artículo presenta una revisión de la actividad, los diferentes tipos de impactos generados y algunas alternativas biológicas para el tratamiento de los efluentes, buscando herramientas para alcanzar una acuicultura responsable.},

A CND multinutrient ratio is a row-centered logratio corrected for the bounded-sum constraint to 100\% of all components, including a filling value between known components and 100\%. CND multinutrient ratios for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg were reduced to three dimensions by principal component analysis (PCA). Varimax-rotated factors–(N -K-Ca+), (Ca+Mg-), and (P–)—were designated as contrasts describing nutrient status and equilibria in diagnostic tissues. CND nutrient indexes for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg were highly correlated with their DRIS counterparts (r = 0.964 to 0.987), using 20 independent observations. Since CND is compatible with PCA, CND could expand DRIS to a multivariate diagnostic approach projecting structured information on nutrient data into a Euclidean space. A critical sphere specific to a developmental stage could delineate the high-yielding subpopulation for diagnostic purposes. The critical radius defined using a probabilistic approach to capture the high yielders should be validated with independent fertilizer experiments.},

  abstract = {Basil (Ocimum basilicum) was cultivated in Rostock, Northern Germany, in a decoupled aquaponic system with African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) under intensive rearing conditions by using three hydroponic components, the dynamic root floating technique (DRF), the raft technique, and grow pipes. A 25\% of the recommended feed input still allowed African catfish growth and provided adequate nitrogen and calcium levels in the process water. After 36 days, the plants were examined with respect to 16 different growth parameters. DRF performed significantly better than raft and/or grow pipes in 11 parameters. Total weight of basil was significantly higher in DRF (107.70 ± 34.03 g) compared with raft (82.02 ± 22.74 g) and grow pipes (77.86 ± 23.93 g). The economically important leaf biomass was significantly higher in wet and dry weight under DRF cultivation (45.36 ± 13.53 g; 4.96 ± 1.57 g) compared with raft (34.94 ± 9.44 g; 3.74 ± 1.04 g) and grow pipes (32.74 ± 9.84 g; 3.75 ± 1.22 g). Two main factors limited plant growth: an unbalanced nutrient concentration ratio and high water temperatures with an average of 28 ◦C (max 34.4 ◦C), which resulted in reduced root activity in raft and grow pipes. DRF was able to maintain root activity through the 5 cm air space between the shoots and the nutrient solution and thus produced significantly more biomass. This suggests DRF to be used for basil aquaponics under glass house conditions with high-temperature scenarios. Future studies are needed to optimize nutrient loads and examine systems with the plant roots exposed to air (Aeroponics).},

For plant nutrition, aquaculture process water from intensive rearing of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) was used without fertilizer. After 39 days, 16 plant growth parameters were compared, with aeroponics performing significantly better in 11 parameters compared with the DRF, and better compared with the raft in 13 parameters. The economically important leaf wet and dry weight was over 40\% higher in aeroponics (28.53 ± 8.74 g; 4.26 ± 1.23 g), but similar in the DRF (20.19 ± 6.57 g; 2.83 ± 0.90 g) and raft (20.35 ± 7.14 g; 2.84 ± 1.04 g). The roots in the DRF grew shorter and thicker; however, this resulted in a higher root dry weight in aeroponics (1.08 ± 0.38 g) compared with the DRF (0.82 ± 0.36 g) and raft (0.67 ± 0.27 g). With optimal fertilizer and system improvement, aquaponic aeroponics (s.s.) could become a productive and sustainable large-scale food production system in the future. Due to its simple construction, the raft is ideal for domestic or semi-commercial use and can be used in areas where water is neither scarce nor expensive. The DRF system is particularly suitable for basil cultivation under hot tropical conditions.},

Growth parameters of goldfish such as length gain (\%), weight gain (\%) and specific growth rate (\% d-1) were significantly higher in T3 (p{$<$}0.05) as compared to T1 and T2. However, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) did not differ between treatments. Similarly, basil plant growth in terms of height gain (\%) and leaves yield (nos. plant-1) were found to be highest in T3 which was significantly different from T1, T2 and control (C). Throughout the experimental period, values of water parameters in all the treatments were found to be in favourable ranges. From the results of the present study, it could be concluded that for maintaining good water quality with highest production in media bed aquaponics, the optimum stocking density is 700 m-3 for goldfish fry and 10 plants per 0.44 m2 for basil plants.},

Simply said, the fish produce nutrient-rich effluent that fertilizes the plants, and the plants filter the water for the fish. Fish waste from the aquaculture portion of the system is broken down by bacteria into dissolved nutrients that plants then utilize to grow in the hydroponic component. This nutrient removal not only improves water quality for the fish but also decreases overall water consumption by limiting the amount released as effluent. The synergistic relationship of the fish and plants has created a popular perception of sustainability around aquaponics by the general public. Additionally, aquaponics can be scaled from a bench-top hobby unit to multi-acre commercial production facilities.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an agricultural practice incorporating aquaculture and hydroponic principles. This study assesses the current system design and production practices of the aquaponic industry, compares these metrics by stakeholder group, identifies trends, and provides recommendations for future development. An electronic survey of aquaponic stakeholders was conducted from December 2019 to June 2020 targeting hobbyists, producers, and educators from various aquaponic-focused professional associations, email and social media groups. Of 378 total responses, 84\% came from the United States and were clustered in plant hardiness zones five to nine. Aquaponic systems were commonly homemade/do-it-yourself (DIY), many of which incorporated commercially available (turn-key) technology. Most growers used coupled systems that integrated recirculating aquaculture systems and either deep-water culture (DWC) or media bed hydroponic units. Common plant lighting sources were sunlight and light emitting diode (LED). Water sources were typically municipal or wells. Personal labor input was typically less than 20 hrs/wk. Funding sources were primarily personal funds, followed by government grants, and private investor funds. System sizes varied greatly, but the median area was 50 to 500 ft               2               for hobbyists and educators and 500 to 3,000 ft               2               for producers. Respondents commonly sold vegetable produce, training and education, food fish, and microgreens. Tilapia and ornamental fish were commonly grown, with 16 other species reported. Common crops were lettuce, leafy greens, basil, tomatoes, peppers, and herbs with many additional lesser-grown crops reported, including cannabis. Overall, the industry still growing, with a large portion of stakeholders having less than two years of experience. However, veteran growers have remained in operation, particularly in the producer and educator groups. The survey results suggest a shift away from outdoor systems, media beds, tomatoes, ornamental fish, and perch production, and a shift toward decoupled systems, DWC, drip irrigation, and wicking beds, larger system area, leafy greens, and trout/salmon production compared to previous industry surveys. The reduced diversity of plant species grown suggest some level of crop standardization. Commercial producers tended to sell more types of products than other stakeholders, suggesting that diversification of offerings may be key to profitability. The combined production area specified by respondents indicates the industry has grown substantially in recent years. Finally, the presence of bank loan-funded operations suggests increased knowledge and comfort with aquaponics among lenders.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen plays critically important role in dual biomasses aquaponic production. This study examined the fate of nitrogen in an aquaponics at different plant-fish (P/F) biomass ratios. A floating raft hydroponic bed with water celery (Oenanthe javanica) as plant species coupled with an aquaculture tank reared with Koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) was evaluated using nitrogen mass balance techniques at P/F biomass ratio of 0.06–0.95 and feed conversion ratios (FCR) maintained at 1.73–1.85 at a constant hydraulic retention time of 24 h. The FCRs in the study were significantly lower than FCR (1.96) in the control (aquaculture only). Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the aquaponics increased from 29.3 ± 3.5 to 39.1 ± 4.2\% as the P/F biomass ratio increased from 0.06 to 0.95, respectively. Furthermore, the increase in P/F biomass ratio to 0.95 exhibited the highest nitrogen uptake rate by plants (\textasciitilde 56 mg/day in the hydroponic bed) which resulted in a levelling-off of the nitrate concentration at 62.5 ± 4.2 mg/L in the aquaculture tank. The increase in P/F biomass ratio also lowered the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 17\% from the aquaponics compared to control. Overall, this study presents evidence that an aquaponics with higher P/F biomass ratio emits less N2O and has higher nutrient recovery with perpetual fish production in a zero water exchange-aquaponic system.},

To date, however, no studies have quantified the environmental and economic profile of Light Emitting Diodes (LED) lighting in indoor farming systems. The goal of this study is to quantify the effect of varying the red (R) and blue (B) LED spectral components (RB ratios of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4) on the eco-efficiency of indoor production of lettuce, chicory, rocket and sweet basil from a life cycle perspective. The functional unit of the assessment was 1 kg of harvested fresh plant edible product, and the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) method was employed for impact assessment. Even though most of the materials of the LED lamp and electronic elements were imported from long distances (14,400 km), electricity consumption was the largest contributor to the environmental impacts (with the LED lamps being the main electricity consumers, approximately 70\%), apart from the resources use indicator, where the materials of the lamps and the mineral nutrients were also relevant. RB0.5 was the most energy-efficient light treatment but had the lowest eco-efficiency scores due to the lower crop yields.},

The fish consume the supplied feed and their waste is naturally converted to nitrate and other nutrients, which are then taken up by the plants, acting as a natural water filter. Regarding food safety, there is concern about nitrate accumulation in leafy vegetables produced using this technique. In this study, three different species are tested using a small-scale aquaponic system in order to determine if they are apt for consumption in terms of nitrate levels in their leaves. The nitrate contents observed (613, 2387.8 and 1425.4 mg kg−1 for romaine lettuce, Swiss chard and curly kale, respectively) are below the limits imposed by the European Commission in the existing regulations. They are also within the range of values obtained for the same vegetables cultivated in a conventional way.},

With it, the use of resources (i.e., water, nutrients, land) is reduced whilst at the same time minimising residues’ discharge to the environment. Among its benefits, it allows the production of healthy vegetables and fish in reduced spaces by means of small-scale systems. In this work, three of them based on FAO models with different hydroponic subsystems (nutrient film technique -NFT-, floating raft, and vertical felt) are tested to produce lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and goldfish (Carassius auratus). Water parameters as well as the growth of plants and fishes were monitored in two different production cycles. The hydroponic subsystem that outperformed the best was the NFT, both in terms of crop production and water consumption. All systems showed similar results in fish production. Further research is needed to corroborate the outputs obtained when using other combinations of plants and fishes. Small-scale aquaponic systems are particularly interesting for selfproduction and even more so in urban environments with reduced available space.},

In addition, the mechanisms by which green facades can be used as passive energy savings systems are reviewed: shadow produced by the vegetation, insulation provided by vegetation and substrate, evaporative cooling by evapotranspiration, and the barrier effect to the wind. Finally, the paper describes the first results about the behaviour of a double-skin green facade or green curtain in Dry Mediterranean Continental conditions. It is verified that a microclimate between the wall of the building and the green curtain is created, and it is characterized by slightly lower temperatures and higher relative humidity. This means that the green screen acts as a wind barrier and confirms the evapotranspiration effect of the plants.},

Contemporary architecture in fact is increasingly focusing on vertical greening systems as a means to restore the environmental integrity of urban areas, biodiversity and sustainability. Applying green façades, which is an established feature of contemporary urban design, can offer multiple environmental benefits on both new and existing buildings and can be a sustainable approach in terms of energy saving considering materials used, nutrients and water needed and efficient preservation of edifices. To provide a full perspective and a viable case study on vertical greening systems a process tree is developed throughout this research. Elaborating the process tree has proved to be a useful methodology to analyse main parameters as climate and building characteristics, avoid damages and maintenance problems caused by inappropriate design, and compare different elements such as technologies, materials, durability, dimensions, and plant species employed.},

To identify the quality, in terms of nitrite and nitrate concentrations, of both spinach and stellate sturgeon meat, obtained under different culture densities (spinach) and feeding regimes (stellate sturgeon), in an integrated aquaponic system. The experiment on spinach was made in triplicate, by using 3 stocking densities: (V1–59crops/ m2, V2–48crops/m2 and V3–39crops/m2). A 9 media grow bed hydroponic modules (LECA) and a 4 ish rearing units RAS were integrated, forming the integrated aquaponic experimental system. Fish were divided in 4 groups and were fed with 41\% brute protein feed, at the following rations: F1-2.21\%; F2-1.85\%; F3-1.64\% and F4-1.28\% of total biomass. Chemical analyses concerning nitrite and nitrate levels were made on 5 samples, by using Griess method -STAS 9065:2002. A statistical signi icant difference (p{$<$}0.05) was recorded between V1 and V3, in terms of both nitrates and nitrites concentrations. Also, higher nitrite and nitrate concentrations were observed on spinach grown under aquaponic conditions, comparing with spinach derived from ield culture. Differences between F1 and F3, F4 nitrite and nitrate concentrations we observed to be signi icant (p{$<$}0.05). Considering the nitrite and nitrate concentrations, spinach grown in aquaponic conditions, as presented above, at densities of 59crops/m2 and 48crops/m2, is marketable. Also, the level of ish meat nitrites and nitrates, from all 4 experimental variants, did not exceed the safety limits for human consumption.},

To quantify the nitrogen budget for a stellate sturgeon –spinach integrated LECA grow bed aquaponic system, where three plants densities were used. The experiment was made in triplicate, using a 12 aquaponic units LECA grow bed aquaponic system. Three crops densities were used (V1–59crops/m2, V2–48crops/m2 and V3– 39crops/m2 and V4–no crops, only with LECA grow bed). Fish were were fed with 41\% brute protein feed, at an average feeding ratio of 1.75\% of total biomass. Water samples were taken and analysed by using photometric methods (Merck kits). The stellate sturgeon meat, spinach and also faeces nitrogen content was determined by Kjeldahl method. Differences between the removal rates for each of the three variants of tested crops densities were signi icant higher (p{$<$}0.05) at V1 compared to V3 and also higher at all three variants comparing them to the control variant. The amount of ammonium removal rates from bio ilter and LECA grow bed was signi icant (p{$<$}0.05). Also, differences between spinach nitrogen composition from V3 compared to V1 were found signi icant higher (p{$<$}0.05). The nitrogen content from ish meat and ish faeces was found to be within normal limits, appear also in the literature. Considering the nitrite and nitrate concentrations, only spinach grown in aquaponic conditions, as presented above, at densities of 59crops/m2, is marketable. In addition, it can be concluded that spinach growth in LECA grow bed aquaponic systems have a higher nitrogen content, comparing with the one growth using loating rafts technique.},

El objetivo de esta  investigación fue evaluar el desarrollo y la viabilidad económica del cultivo de lechuga  romana (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia) y de tilapia nilótica (Oreochromis niloticus) y  tilapia roja (Oreochromis mossambicus x spp.) en un sistema acuapónico con cama con  sustrato de gravilla, variando la densidad en la crianza de las tilapias; además se  observó la influencia de esta variable en el desarrollo y producción de las plantas. Para  esto se construyeron 4 prototipos acuapónicos (SA1= 0 g, SA2= 100 g, SA3= 150 g y  SA4= 200 g de biomasa por tanque) en una casa ubicada en Arroyo Hondo, D.N., y se  sembraron 10 plantas de lechuga romana por sistema, los cuales sirvieron de unidades  experimentales. Se dividieron en dos bloques según la intensidad de la luz que  recibieron. Durante 5 semanas se recolectaron los datos de las plantas de lechuga  romana, de los peces y de la calidad de agua. Se concluye que la mejor cama de  acuaponía con sustrato de gravilla para el desarrollo de la lechuga romana dentro del  actual experimento, fue la SA3 con 150 g de biomasa y 10 cultivos de plantas en 0.6  m². Por otro lado, el sistema construido en las condiciones del actual experimento  presentó no ser viable económicamente en ninguno los tratamientos. Se anima a la  profundización en los estudios de acuaponía en los ámbitos económicos así como  técnicos.},

In order to study responses of oleaster to environmental stress in vivo and in vitro, we successfully sterilized and initiated its callus cultures, regenerated shoots and roots and finally whole plants from the callus. Application of ammonium (in the form of sulfate salt) to the regenerated plantlets at concentrations higher than 10 mg L-1 inhibited root growth, reduced the leaf chlorophyll content and the activity of the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase. At the same time, it induced activities of the stress marker enzyme glutathione S-transferase in the root and shoot tissues of the plant.},

A hydroponics treatment (50\% Steiner nutrient solution) was used as a control. Plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf area, fresh and dry weight, number of flowers and vase life were measured in plants, as well as pH, electrical conductivity, nutrient concentration in aquaponic nutrient solution and nutrient content in plant tissue. Length, width and weight of fish also were measured. Aquaponics + FF had negative effects on leaves and flowers and on plant quality. Aquaponics + N, K, Ca and S generated optimum nutrient concentrations in solution and in plant tissue, as well as optimum growth and development (leaf area, dry weight, fresh weight, number of flowers and vase life) of lilies, yielding a good standard for quality of flowers.},

Densities of 10, 15, 20 and 25 kg m-3 of tilapia (Rocky Mountain strain.) with a plant density of 25 lettuce m-2 were established in an aquaponic system. The variables measured were related to vegetative growth (fresh weight, plant height and stem diameter), nutrient content in plant tissue (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn and B) and concentration of N-NO3-, P-H2PO42-, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the nutrient solution, during two aquaponic cycles of lettuce cultivation. The highest fresh lettuce weight, plant height, stem diameter, nutrients in aquaponic solution and tissue nutrients content were obtained with a fish density of 25 kg m-3. The nutrient concentration in aquaponic nutrient solution increased according to fish density. At the end of experiment (60 days after transplanting), N-NO3-, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentration reached its highest values of 105, 38.5 and 38 mg L-1, respectively; meanwhile P-H2PO42- and K+ reached its highest concentration (15 and 14 mg L-1, respectively) between 21 and 35 days after starting the experiment. These results indicate that the aquaponic system provide only 62\% of N-NO3-, 48\% of P, 5\% of K, 21\% of Ca and 79\% of Mg in relation to the Steiner Universal Nutrient Solution for hydroponics. However normal tissue nutrient content was observed, with exception of K, Ca and Cu, but no signs of nutrient deficiencies were observed in lettuce leaves.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a sustainable technique that is respectful to the environment, as it reuses products and minimizes the consumption of new materials. The combination of this technique with the foliar application of selenium (as Na2SeO4) could lead to healthier and more sustainable products, which are increasingly requested by consumers. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) plants were grown in an aquaponics system (fish water) as compared with a control (conventional soilless fertigation), and sprayed with different concentrations of selenium (0, 4, 8, and 16 µmol L−1). The results showed a reduction in the dry weight and N content of lettuce plants irrigated with the fish water mixture treatment. However, the application of Se relieved this stress, increasing the photosynthetic rate and ABTS, and reducing the content of chlorophylls, β-carotene, and several of the measured amino acids. The best results were observed with the highest concentration of Se (16 µmol L−1), as an increase in nitrogen content was observed, as shown by a greater weight of the plant. Furthermore, this treatment produced the greatest increase in ABTS and the least reduction in amino acid content. This novel study highlights the possibility of improving the efficiency of N utilization in lettuce by applying foliar selenium in combination with an aquaponics system.},

  abstract = {Se has beneficial effects on plants, through the stimulation of plant productivity, the reduction of abiotic stresses, and the improvement in N metabolism. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the foliar application of different concentrations of Se (0, 4, 8 and 16 μmol L− 1) on lettuce plants grown in an aquaponics system (fish water) compared with a control (conventional soilless fertigation). The NO3- concentration supplied by the fish water was 47\% of the control solution. The results showed a reduction in the fresh weight of lettuce plants irrigated with the fish water mixture treatment, along with an increase in sugar concentration. However, the application of Se at 4 and 16 μmol L− 1, prompted a relief of this stress, reducing both lipid peroxidation and the sugar content, and increasing the nitrate concentration. In addition, in the case of the highest concentration of Se (16 μmol L− 1), the values of nitrate were comparable those control plants. We show the importance of sprayed Se in increasing the efficiency of N utilization, in addition to lessening environmental issues for aquaponics culture.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between salinity in the performance of marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and halophyte plant Sarcocornia ambigua in an aquaponic system with biofloc. The experiment was conducted for 57 days, and four treatments were evaluated: 8 psu (practical salinity unity), 16 psu, 24 psu, and 32 psu, with three replicates. Each experimental unit consisted of an 800 L tank for shrimp rearing, a 40 L settling chamber and a hydroponic bench of 0.3 m2 of planting area and density of 40 plants m−2. The tank water was continuously pumped to the settling chamber, and the supernatant was distributed on the hydroponic bench to irrigate the plants, returning to the tank by gravity. The tanks were stocked with 300 shrimp m−3 (1.6 ± 0.1 g). The shrimp were fed four times daily with a commercial diet containing 38\% crude protein. Salinity affected shrimp survival, which was lower in 8 psu treatment (56.3 ± 4.7\%). No salinity relationships were detected with any of the plant performance parameters; however, the highest biomass was produced at 16 psu, which is close to the isosmotic point of S. ambigua. The lowest concentrations of ammonia and nitrite and the highest concentrations of nitrate were found, through the interpolation of the data, near the 18 psu salinity. So, it is suggested that in this salinity, the absorption of ammonia by the plants is favored. The salinity also affected the concentration of dissolved orthophosphate. There was no relationship between salinity and the production of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in plants. The integrated cultivation of L. vannamei with S. ambigua can be carried out between salinities of 16 and 24 psu since the performance of the shrimp is not impaired, and the growth of the plants and the removal of nitrogen and phosphate compounds are favored in this range of salinity.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the integrated culture of Sarcocornia ambigua and Pacific white shrimp in an aquaponic system with biofloc. The experiment was performed for 73 days and two treatments were evaluated: plants and control (without plants), with four replicates. Each experimental unit consisted of an 800 L tank, a 40 L conical bottom settling chamber, and a hydroponic bench with 0.4 m2 of planting area and a capacity for 40 plants. The water from the shrimp tank was pumped continuously to the settling chamber and the overflow was distributed to the channels to irrigate the plants, then returned to the tank by gravity. Tanks were stocked with 250 shrimp m−3 (1.4 ± 0.0 g). Shrimp were fed a commercial diet containing 35\% crude protein, four times per day. At the end of the experiment, total nitrogen was determined in the shrimp, the plants and the ration, as well as antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds in Sarcocornia. The water quality remained within the acceptable limits for the culture of marine shrimp. No significant differences were observed in the performance of L. vannamei. The final biomass of shrimp was 2.1 ± 0.1 kg m−3, with a survival rate of 73.5 ± 1.9\%, a final average weight of 11.7 ± 0.4 g, and a feed conversion ratio of 1.7 ± 0.1. The production of plants was 8.2 ± 0.3 kg m−2. The antioxidant activity in S. ambigua was 38.3 ± 1.3 ␮mol TEAC 100 g−1 FM, which characterizes this species as a functional food. The recovery of nitrogen supplied to the system through the ration was higher in the plants treatment (39.3\%) than in the control (31.4\%). In the proposed aquaponic system it was possible to produce 2 kg of plants for each kilogram of shrimp, integrating the production of L. vannamei and S. ambigua, and thus improve the use of nutrients in the culture.},

  abstract = {Decoupled FLOCponics (DFP) is a promising aquaponics approach which takes advantage of the nutritional benefits of biofloc technology (BFT). Enabling the use of less protein in the fish diets is one of the benefits of BFT. The effect of the reduction of protein content, and consequently the input of nitrogen, on fish and plant pro­ duction in DFP systems has not yet been investigated. This study was designed to investigate and evaluate the production of lettuce and tilapia juveniles in a DFP system using different levels of crude protein (CP) in the fish diets. The zootechnical performance of tilapia juveniles and lettuce growth in the DFP system were evaluated, using different diets containing 24, 28, 32, and 36\% CP. Fish production in DFP systems was compared to those reared in traditional decoupled aquaponics systems (DAPS) and in biofloc-based systems (BFT), both fed with 32\% CP diet. The experimental period of tilapia juvenile production lasted 56 days. Lettuce production in two cycles was also performed in DFP systems with different CP levels and their growth was compared to those in DAPS and hydroponics systems, as control treatments. In Cycle 1, the seedling phase was evaluated in a 14-day trial. In Cycle 2, the final production phase was performed for 21 days until harvest. The physical-chemical parameters of the water were monitored in the aquaculture and hydroponic subsystems. High mortality of fish occurred in DFP-36 in the middle of the experiment, thus this treatment was discontinued. The results showed that tilapia reared in DFP and fed with 24 and 28\% CP (DFP-24 and DFP-28) grew similarly to those in DAPS fed with 32\% CP diet. Fish in DFP-32 and BFT fed with 32\% CP diet grew similarly and above the other treatments. Additionally, plant growth results showed no differences in both cycles among all treatments. With respect to water parameters, even though more nutrients were inputted in the treatments with high CP content in the aquaculture subsystem, the mean values of nitrogen compounds and orthophosphate were similar in all treatments. For water parameters in the hydroponics subsystems, only the mean values of pH in Cycle 1 were statistically different in the plant treatments. The results obtained in this study indicate that using less CP in fish diets to produce lettuce and tilapia juveniles is technically possible and feasible in a decoupled FLOCponics system.},

  abstract = {Biofloc-based fish production involves a dense microbial co-culture that supports nutrient cycling, generally reducing the amount of feed utilized and the need for mechanic and biological filters. These technical benefits of biofloc technology can lower the costs compared to traditional intensive techniques such as recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). The RAS is conventionally adopted to integrated fish-plant production in aquaponics systems, and recent studies demonstrated the potential for integrating biofloc technology and hydroponics production in FLOCponics systems. The present study compared the economic viability for integrated agriaquaculture production of tilapia juveniles and lettuce in FLOCponics (FP) and conventional aquaponics (AP) systems. The study was developed as an investment analysis for the commercial production of tilapia juveniles and lettuce in Brazil under four different scenarios. Two scenarios considered previous experimental results of marketable lettuce in both systems, i.e., 37\% of total lettuce production would be marketable in FP (scenario 1) and 98\% marketable lettuce in AP (scenario 2). The other two scenarios (using FP and AP systems) considered a hypothetical production in which all the lettuce produced have the marketable quality (scenario 3 and 4, respectively). The economic viability indicators calculated were: Internal Rate of Return (IRR); Net Present Value (NPV); PayBack (PB); Discounted PayBack (DPB); Benefit/Cost ratio (B/C) and Discounted Benefit/Cost ratio (DB/DC). The results showed that the production of Nile tilapia juveniles and lettuce in AP (scenario 2) is profitable, but the 37\% marketable lettuce from FP (scenario 1) is not. Both hypothetical scenarios 3 and 4 were identified as profitable. A break-even point was calculated in scenario 1 (FP) to assess the quantities of plants that should be visually suitable for marketing to make such an investment project economically profitable. It was estimated that 68.7\% of the lettuces produced should have desirable visual marketable characteristics to make FP feasible. The results show that investing in research to evaluate a multi-cycle production to prove the stability of long-term FLOCponics projects is highly recommended since the financial analysis indicates that FLOCponics could be financially feasible.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics production is emerging as an alternative for effluent treatment and aquaculture diversification. Also, aquaponics contributes to save water and for the maximum utilization of nutrients and culture areas. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effluent derived from biofloc technology (BFT) tilapia culture on the aquaponics production of three varieties of lettuce Lactuca sativa: red lettuce, butter lettuce, and crispy lettuce, using the clear-water recirculation system (CW) as a control. A total of six treatments were evaluated: BFT- RED; CW- RED; BFT- BUTTER; CW- BUTTER; BFT- CRISPY and CW-CRISPY, with three repetitions each during 21 days. Two systems were used, BFT and CW, each one containing respectively: a 500 L tilapia Oreochromis niloticus culture tank (∼70 g initial weight), clarifiers, biological filter and nine floating beds hydroponic units. Planktonic community profile was weekly measured in BFT. The results suggested that BFT achieved better plant growth regardless of the variety. In addition, at the end of experimental period, a plant quality index was analyzed and indicated that BFT provided superior plants. The plant productivity (kg m−2) of the varieties red, butter and crispy on the BFT system was respectively 0.56, 1.94 and 1.36 kg m−2, while on the CW was 0.28, 1.53 and 1.04 kg m−2. In addition, the butter variety showed the best performance in each analyzed variable, followed by the crispy and the red. The most abundant groups of planktonics organisms (decreasing order) were the filamentous cyanobacteria, ciliated protozoa, chlorophytes, diatoms, oligochaetes and ostracods. The results indicate that BFT presented as a viable alternative for the aquaponics production, especially for the butter variety. © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The experiment was carried out for 46 days and consisted of two cycles of lettuce production (23 days each) and one cycle of juvenile production. The physical–chemical variables of the water, zootechnical performance of the fish, growth performance and visual characteristics of the plants, nutrient dynamics, and characterization of the planktonic community were evaluated in both systems. The results showed better fish productive performance in FP, with a mean final weight of 36.7 g compared with 34.9 g in AP. For plants, the Cycle 2 in the AP system showed the best plant growth and visual results (98\% of the plants received the highest scores—grades A (excellent) and B (good)—on the plant quality index), whereas in FP only 37\% achieved these grades in the same cycle. The results suggest that the integrated production of tilapia juveniles and lettuce using FP might be technically feasible if specific fertilization management or mechanisms are developed to refine the critical points of the system (e.g., nutrient imbalance and solids accumulation in the plant roots) to improve plant production.},

However, they are not well-accepted in all markets, and finding alternative species is important in order to increase the variety of food products and meet market demands. South America has several potential fish species for aquaponics systems. Encouraging the implementation of integrated aquaculture systems by providing information about the production of South American species can help to increase the supply of high-quality food and aquaculture diversification. Thus, data for five South American fish species with potential for aquaponics were compared with existing data for the main traditional warm water species in this system, tilapia and catfish. Moreover, the degree of suitability of the novel species for these systems in terms of zootechnical performance, tolerance to water quality and nutritional composition of fish flesh were discussed. The South American species considered were jundia or silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen), yellowtail lambari (Astyanax lacustris), pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and snook (Centropomus spp.). Their description and the tabular comparison with the most traditional aquaponic-cultured species show they are suited for this production system. How suitable they are will depend on the system design, as well as the regional characteristics of the market where they will be produced.},

  abstract = {FLOCponics is an intensive integrated agri-aquaculture system that combines biofloc-based aquaculture with hydroponics. Since research on FLOCponics is in its early stage of development, and many aspects of this system still need to be explored, the objective of this study was to assess and discuss the sustainability of a FLOCponics system and compare it to stand-alone biofloc and hydroponic cultures. This investigation will lead to a novel perspective of what troubling points need to be covered in the FLOCponics research field before they turn into a commercial scale problem. To do this, we conducted an experiment-based study by applying emergy synthesis to assess the sustainability of tilapia juveniles and lettuce production in FLOCponics, biofloc and/or hydroponic systems. The results indicate that the resources from the larger economy were the inputs that made the greatest contribution in all systems. Overall, most of the emergy indicators are similar for all systems, suggesting that FLOCponics, biofloc and hydroponic systems use low amounts of natural renewable resources, cause a moderate environmental load (EIR and ELR of 3.1 to 3.6), and lead to environmental stress seven times higher than the contribution to the economy (ESI of 0.3). Unit emergy values (UEVs) are different for each system, indicating that, under the evaluated conditions, FLOCponics (UEV: 2.54E + 06 sej/J) is more efficient than hydroponics (UEV: 5.55E + 10 sej/J) and less efficient than a biofloc system (UEV: 1.42E + 06 sej/J). Our findings provide valuable insights regarding the (un)sustainable aspects of FLOCponics and direct further research to improve the system’s emergy performance. Based on the emergy performance, FLOCponics can be considered a promising sustainable food production approach, mainly considering that it is a system under development and there are still many opportunities for improvement.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The main objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of both programmed (speed, agility, and quickness; SAQ) and random (small-sided games; SSG) conditioning methods on selected neuromuscular and physical performance variables. Methods: Twenty volunteers (21.1 ± 4.0 y, 1.71 ± 0.09 m, 66.7 ± 9.9 kg; mean ± SD) completed the study. The study design used two physically challenging periodized experimental conditions (SAQ and SSG conditions) and a nonexercise control condition (CON). Participants engaged in 12.2 ± 2.1 h of directed physical conditioning. All participants had at least 24 h of recovery between conditioning sessions, and each 1-h session included 15 min of general warm-up and a 45-min exercise session. Participants completed a battery of tests (15-m sprint, isokinetic flexion/extension, depth jump) before and following the training program. Results: There was a 6.9\% (95\% CI: −4.4 to 18.3) greater improvement in 5-m acceleration time and 4.3\% (95\% CI: −0.9 to 9.5) in 15-m mean running velocity time for the SAQ group compared with the SSG group. In addition, increases in maximal isokinetic concentric strength for both the flexor and extensor muscles, with the exception of 180 °/s flexion, were greater in the SAQ than SSG condition. The SAQ group also showed 19.5\% (95\% CI: −11.2 to 50.2) greater gain in reactive strength (contact time depth jump) and 53.8\% (95\% CI: 11.2 to 98.6) in mean gastrocnemius medialis activity in comparison with SSG. Conclusions: SAQ training should benefit the physical conditioning programs of novice players performing invasion games. Time-motion analysis of movement patterns from various team sports indi-cates that speed, agility, and quickness (SAQ) are important for performance during match play. 1,2 For example, international soccer players performed 28\% more high-intensity running and 58\% more sprinting than players of a lower standard.},

  abstract = {In the first part of this paper, we review the extent to which various types of plant growth models incorporate ecophysiological mechanisms. Many growth models have a central role for the process of photosynthesis; and often implicitly assume C-gain to be the rate-limiting step for biomass accumulation. We subsequently explore the extent to which this assumption actually holds and under what condition constraints on growth due to a limited sink strength are likely to occur. By using generalized dose–response curves for growth with respect to light and CO2, models can be tested against a benchmark for their overall performance. In the final part, a call for a systems approach at the supra-cellular level is made. This will enable a better understanding of feedbacks and trade-offs acting on plant growth and its component processes. Mechanistic growth models form an indispensable element of such an approach and will, in the end, provide the link with the (sub-)cellular approaches that are yet developing. Improved insight will be gained if model output for the various physiological processes and morphological variables (‘virtual profiling’) is compared with measured correlation networks among these processes and variables. Two examples of these correlation networks are presented.},

In the previous millennium, the utilization of the nutrients introduced into the system was the main aspect of the integration. In Hungary, technologies that integrated fish production with growing crops and animal husbandry appeared, including for example: large-scale fish-cum-rice production; fish-cum-duck production; and integrated pig-fish farming which were introduced in the second half of the 20th century. Today, the emphasis is on integrating the use of the kind of feed where the main goal is to minimize nutrient loads in the surrounding natural ecosystems and to maximize the utilization of the unit’s water resources. The various modern integrated freshwater aquaculture systems, such as intensive fish production combined with wetland, recirculation aquaculture system and multi-functional aquaculture, have proved their viability. However, the future opportunities for these systems have not always been properly recognized and acknowledged when the future of European aquaculture is discussed.},

  abstract = {Monopterus albus is a freshwater fish species with the potential to be developed as a farmed fish in the future. The eel demand for domestic and export markets is increasing each year. For the market’s increasing demand, it is necessary to cultivate good technology and management in order to obtain good results. One way to conduct fish farming is by optimizing the stocking density and quality of the water in the maintenance container. One of the systems used is the Aquaponics system. Aquaponics are one of the cultivation technologies available that combine fish farming with water plants. This study aimed to find out the influences of the eel stocking density differences on the growth rate and survival rate of eels in aquaponics. The experiment used a completely randomized design (CRD) with two of five treatments and five replications; P0 (20 eels m-2), P1 (10 eels m-2), P2 (30 eels m-2) and P3 (40 eels m-2). The observed parameters were the growth rate and survival rate of the eels. The analysis of the data was conducted using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and this was then followed by Duncan's Multiple Range Test. Based on the research, the survival rate (p {$<$}0.05) showed that there was a significant difference in the rate of growth (p {$<$}0.05). Based on the research results, the stocking density of 30 eels is m-2. We obtained the highest specific growth rate in the amount of 0.339 ± 0.116\% and the highest survival rate was 79\%.},

Based on the observation, the researcher concludes that, it is necessary to increase the students’ ecoliteracy in the utilization of the school area. By looking at the problems occurring in class VII-B, the researcher intends to conduct classroom action research by applying the aquaponic learning model of the Social Studies learning. The research design used in this research is a Lewin cycle model according to Elliot. During the execution, this study was conducted 2 cycles, with 5 actions in each cycle consisting of an understanding of ecoliteracy, aquaponic project creation, aquaponic project maintenance, aquaponic harvesting process, accountability report, and harvesting of crops into healthy foods. Based on the results of students’ ecoliteracy research, in the utilization of school area on the cycle 1 results have shown an improvement, but the improvement is not maximal, with the average group assessment entered into the "Good" category. While in the cycle 2 experienced a significant improvement, making the percentage of group valuation to entered into the "Excellent" category.

  abstract = {Community empowerment in optimizing integrated housing is aimed at making the community to be able to utilize the houses in order to improve the quality of the environment and people's lives. In addition, community empowerment must be able to run sustainably so as to provide sustainable benefits for the community. Proper yard management in this case is an integrated yard by combining various yard management technologies. In the community empowerment program, it adopts technology from an integrated farming system that are utilizing fish, plants and livestock. The series of activities in the community empowerment program for the yard utilization include providing various training in managing the yard and supporting technology. The provided training including composting from livestock manure and inorganic waste, introduction of biopore, and planning an integrated yard making. The series of activities carried out within a period of 2 months. Training is given so that the community can be independent in making integrated yards, so that this program can provide benefits on an ongoing basis. In this empowerment program, training is carried out and making sample yards using an integrated system. Integrated yard management design includes chicken coops or cattle, fish ponds, and vegetable or medicinal plants. The three components are designed to provide integrated benefits. The main design is a cattle pen placed above the fish pond, and plants placed around the pond. In general, the system is built so that manure will be disposed into the fish ponds to become feed. Then the water from the fish pond can be recirculate to irrigate the plants.},

Another problem caused by the rapid growing population is the relocation of agriculture industries to the countryside. This will result in higher price for food, air pollution, and traffic jam. Indoor controlled environment agriculture is one of the strategies that can help the city, so it can produce its own food and create sustainable lifestyle. This paper focuses on how to create Jakarta, one of the big cities in South East Asia, into a city based on agricultural system that can ensure food safety and make a sustainable urban lifestyle without damaging the environment. Also, it discusses the possibilities of converting the urban or building space into agricultural space, which can support the food production for the people of Jakarta.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics’ potential to transform urban food production has been documented in a rapid increase of academic research and public interest in the field. To translate this publicity into real-world impact, the creation of commercial farms and their relationship to the urban environment have to be further examined. This research has to bridge the gap between existing literature on growing system performance and urban metabolic flows by considering the built form of aquaponic farms. To assess the potential for urban integration of aquaponics, existing case studies are classified by the typology of their building enclosure, with the two main categories being greenhouses and indoor environments. This classification allows for some assumptions about the farms’ performance in their context, but a more in-depth life cycle assessment (LCA) is necessary to evaluate different configurations. The LCA approach is presented as a way to inventory design criteria and respective strategies which can influence the environmental impact of aquaponic systems in the context of urban built environments.},

  abstract = {As the building sector faces global challenges that affect urban supplies of food, water and energy, multifaceted sustainability solutions need to be re-examined through the lens of built environments. Aquaponics, a strategy that combines recirculating aquaculture with hydroponics to optimize fish and plant production, has been recognized as one of "ten technologies which could change our lives" by merit of its potential to revolutionize how we feed urban populations. To holistically assess the environmental performance of urban aquaponic farms, impacts generated by aquaponic systems must be combined with impacts generated by host envelopes. This paper outlines the opportunities and challenges of using life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate and design urban aquaponic farms. The methodology described here is part of a larger study of urban integration of aquaponics conducted by the interdisciplinary research consortium CITYFOOD. First, the challenges of applying LCA in architecture and agriculture are outlined. Next, the urban aquaponic farm is described as a series of unit process flows. Using the ISO 14040:2006 framework for developing an LCA, subsequent LCA phases are described, focusing on scenario-specific challenges and tools. Particular attention is given to points of interaction between growing systems and host buildings that can be optimized to serve both. Using a hybrid LCA framework that incorporates methods from the building sector as well as the agricultural sector, built environment professionals can become key players in interdisciplinary solutions for the food-water-energy nexus and the design of sustainable urban food systems.},

However, healthy and environment-friendly plant-based food production is very time-consuming. Water quality checking by the human resource is no longer efficient in the presence of technology today. Thus, a water quality monitoring system for aquaponics and fishpond is proposed in this study adapting the use of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, and Wi-Fi signal. The completed system was successfully tested and implemented at the Malaysian Institute of Sustainable Agriculture (MISA). The devices send measurements to a base station which hosted a web server which can be viewed both locally and via the Internet. Results show the system is practical in use as it is both stable and reliable with 5 seconds maximum measurement refresh rate on its dashboard. Thus, reduces human dependency for monitoring the water quality of both the aquaponics and fishpond. Human resource can then be allocated to more crucial roles. Room for improvement includes complete use of solar renewable energy, adding Wi-Fi extender for large scale implementation, and equipping the Raspberry Pi with a cooling fan. This is the step forward to modernising agriculture.},

Both species were grown in a floating system for leaf production with recurrent harvests. The nutrient solutions contained different concentrations of nitrate (1 and 10 mM) and a synthetic sea salt (0 and 10 g L−1), in a factorial design, where the saline solution with a low nitrate level intended to mimic the typical nutritional conditions of saltwater aquaponics. In both species, increasing the salinity or reducing the N level in the nutrient solution reduced the crop yield and total dry biomass. In both Swiss chard and sea beet, the use of saline water resulted in a lower leaf concentration of K, Ca, Cu, and Mn, and a greater content of Na and Cl. In Swiss chard, an increase in Na and Cl and a decrease in K leaf content were found in successive harvests. On average, sea beet showed a higher leaf production and accumulation of nitrate than Swiss chard.},

  abstract = {Saltwater aquaponics is a sustainable alternative system for food production. The success of this system largely depends on the selection of both fish and plant species, for which several features and criteria must be considered. This paper aims to identify the most suitable plant species for saltwater aquaponics by using a multi-criteria decision-making method also based on current literature. One simple model that contained one root criterion, four aggregated criteria, and four sub-criteria was created using DEXi software. The same model was evaluated considering two different salinity levels in the recirculating water: 10 (brackish water) and 35 (sea water) g L−1. The relevance of the model structure was evaluated by the sensitivity analysis, through the ‘plus/minus-1 analysis. Our results suggest that Salicornia europaea L. and Portulaca oleracea L. were suitable species for saltwater aquaponics at 35 g L−1. Moreover, at 10 g L−1, the suitable candidates were: Salicornia bigelovii Torr, S. europaea L., Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima (L.) Arcang, Atriplex hortensis L., and P. oleracea L. The DEXi analysis resulted in being an easy and effective tool to select proper species in similar contexts. DEXi can help to identify the hotspots of production processes, according to our results. Since the selected species are wild edible species or minor crops, the availability of their seeds is one of the main constraints of their cultivation in saltwater aquaponics.},

  abstract = {Increasing fish cultivation activity triggers negative impact on the environment. An effort likely applied to cope with this problem is phytoremediation with aquaponics system. Aims of this study were to process organic waste from the cultivation of gouramy, and then the processed waste is utilized as a medium for growing romaine lettuce in recirculation systems and to compare the effectiveness of hydroponics-aquaponics recirculation system on romaine lettuce growth. Organic waste such as feed residuals and feces from the cultivation of gouramy could be processed with phytoremediation by romaine lettuce. The organic material after the process of decomposition could be utilized for romaine lettuce growth. Final weight of romaine lettuce was 90.16 ± 13.3 g for P4 (hydroponics), 89.4 ± 7.4 g for P2 (aquaponics with 10 romaine lettuce), and 85 ± 11.5 g for P3 (aquaponics with 20 romain lettuce). The highest daily growth (DGR) and relative growth (RGR) were P4 (hydroponics) of 0.056 ± 0.001 cm/day and 0.007 ± 0.002 g/day, respectively. Organic waste from the cultivation of gouramy can be processed with phytoremediation by romaine lettuce. Organic materials such as feed residuals and feces after the process of decomposition can be utilized for romaine lettuce growth. Meanwhile the highest daily growth (GR), specific growth (SGR) and survival rate (SR) of gouramy were P2 (aquaponics with 10 romaine lettuce) at 7.43 ± 1.77g/fish/day, 1.26 ± 0.12\%/day, 100\%, respectively. However, the best feed conversion ratio (FCR) was P3 (aquaponics with 20 romaine lettuce) of 0.59 ± 0.28.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the recirculating aquaponics system has gained high attention and significant popularity for organic vegetables and fruits production which contributes to the sustainable aquaculture for tropical regions. This review aims to summarize the possibility for practicing intercropping in aquaponics to produce high-quality fruits, vegetables and fish without any chemical fertilizer and minimum ecological impact for a sustainable agriculture. Although many studies have addressed about aquaponics for producing high-value crops such as tomato, cucumber, and lettuce, there is still a lack of complete information to support the development of intercropping in aquaponics and limited focus on its commercial implementation. Moreover, this study will focus first on the requirements for inserting intercropping in aquaponics and technical improvements needed to adapt as potential for sustainable food production system to increase productivity around the world, especially in countries have deficiency in water and land resources as well as soil problem like salinity and reduce environmental emissions. Secondly, the insertion of intercropping in aquaponics must be for crops with high value and for crops that can complement together such as tomato with basil and tomato with lettuce. Thirdly, in technical improvement in this study will summarize the strategies and factors that affect the intercropping in aquaponics system such as the nutrients needed for crops under intercropping aquaponics, stocking density and feeding rate which are important to know the concentration of ammonia that is produced and converted to nitrate so that the plants can uptake it. Studying the requirements for inserting and improving intercropping in aquaponics will increase our understanding of needed for new agriculture technique that contributes to the sustainable aquaponics for tropical regions.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponic systems. To increase fish production, aquaponic system can be used as an option because it can increase fish production with high density in limited land and water. The problem that often occurs in fish farming with high or intensive stocking densities is a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration due to high oxygen consumption requirements. Handling that can be done to maintain the availability of dissolved oxygen concentration is by adding aeration by using Fine Bubbles (FBs). This research was conducted in October - December 2019 at the Green House Ciparanje Land Aquaculture Area, Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, UNPAD. The purpose of this research is to increase the growth of striped catfish with optimal density using the application of Fine Bubbles (FBs) and to improve the water quality of rearing media and plant productivity in aquaponic system. The research method used is an experimental method with randomized block design (RBD) consisting of four treatments and three repetitions. The treatment in this study is the spread of 375 striped catfish/150L, 450 striped catfish/150L, 525 striped catfish/150L and 600 striped catfish/150L. The parameters observed included specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), fish survival (SR), water quality and plant growth. During the research, two harvests of water spinach were harvested in one cycle of fish rearing. The results show that the use of aquaponic systems and the addition of aerated FBs can increase the stocking density of striped catfish fingerlings to 600 striped catfish/150 L, with a high fish survival rate of 98\% at a specific growth rate of 4.41 g and a feed conversion ratio of 1.00 g. The results of water quality observations for pH and DO parameters still meet the requirements but for temperature and ammonia, it has exceeded the safe threshold based on SNI (2000). The result of observation of water spinach plants, that the highest productivity in both harvests was in treatment C (525 striped catfish/ 150 L) up to 197.44 g, final plant height 44.54-47.10 cm and for the number of final leaves ranging from 9-10 leaves.},

  abstract = {In intensive aquaculture farming activities will generate solid waste and liquid waste that comes from feces and leftover fish feed. The waste accumulation can lead to deterioration of water quality that affects the physiological processes, behavior, growth, and mortality of fish. Technological innovation is needed for the management of water quality and increase productivity as a result of shrinkage of aquaculture land. One of the technological innovations that can be applied is the incorporation of fish farming with crops through the aquaponics system. This study aims to determine the effects of water spinach optimum density to absorb waste ammonia (NH3), nitrate (NO3) and nitrite (NO2) optimally to increase the survival rate and growth rate of African catfish (Clarias sp.) in intensive aquaculture as well as to see its effect on conversion rates and feed efficiency with aquaponics system. The method used is the experimental method. The experimental research is used to determine the effect of certain variable towards a group under controlled conditions. The results of measurements of ammonia levels during P0 showed that the treatment significantly different (p {$<$}0.05) with treatment P1; P2; and P3. P3 treatment with water spinach number 40 stems provides maximum results in lowering the concentration of ammonia compared with treatment P0 (without spinach), P1 (20 water spinach), and P2 (30 water spinach). The measurement results nitrite levels during the observation showed that all treatments there were no significant differences (p{$>$} 0.05). The measurement results also showed that the nitrate content whole of observation results showed that all treatments there were no significant differences (p{$>$} 0.05). The best feed conversion ratio was found in P3 treatment of 1.08. The best feed efficiency was found in P3 treatment of 92,25\%. The highest survival rate was found in P3 treatment (88.69\%) and lowest survival rate was in P0 treatment (26,71\%). The highest specific growth rate was found in P3 treatment (1.15\%), while the lowest specific growth rate was in treatment P0 (0.79\%). Results of water quality measurement supporting all treatments decreased and increased. The supporting water quality is temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. The decrease and increase in support water quality are caused by environmental factors such as weather. Other parameters were observed in addition to supporting the water quality is water spinach plant growth. Value growth water spinach is best found in treatment P3. In the treatment P3, water spinach growth rose 5.14 cm with an initial size of 10.92 into 16.06.},

  abstract = {Dumbo catfish known as freshwater commodity which its culturing has been done throughout every region in Indonesia. Compared to other freshwater commodity, dumbo catfish has a fairly higher nutrient content, higher economical value, faster growth and easier maintenance. There are various ways to culture dumbo catfish, one of them is by using aquaponic system, which described as a combination of hydroponic and aquaculture in closed water recirculation system. Aquaponic system uses various type of planting media for filtering water, so that ammonia and nitrite are reduced then modified as nitrate, where nitrate absorbed by plants. This study uses 3 different media: cocopeat, hydroton, and husk charcoal. This study aims to investigate whether three previous media can absorb ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate in dumbo catfish culturing using aquaponic system, also figuring out the most effective one. This study uses RAL method with 4 treatments: control (P0), cocopeat (P1), hydroton (P2), husk charcoal (P3) repeated 5 times. The main parameter are ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate, then analyzed using ANOVA. The result showed 3 different media absorbed ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate significantly, with husk charcoal as the most effective media with ammonia, nitrite, nitrate level 0,59 mg/L, 0,37 mg/L, and 4,99 mg/L respectively.},

Three sources of data were considered for the study: (1) three active aquaponics farms, (2) a university greenhouse experiment, and (3) published research. The first analysis compares the economics of aquaponics and hydroponics systems under similar operations. Results suggest that the aquaponics system requires higher investment and operating cost but has lower production of vegetables compared with the hydroponics system. However, if aquaponics vegetable production is managed as an organic production, and the produce is sold at 20\% premium price, aquaponics becomes profitable. The second analysis constructed three different representative farm sizes of aquaponics production of basil and tilapia—small, medium, and large. The production of basil provides better economic returns than the fish. All farm sizes are feasible when the basil price is above \$10.00 per kg. The larger farm has the best results because of lower cost of production.},

However, the literature has yet to consider a range of external forces that affect farmers’ decision-making processes. We argue that climate change and institutions are latent explanatory vari­ ables that require attention in the literature on aquatic-based innovations. Our aim is to conduct an ex-ante analysis focusing on these two external forces in the context of aquaculture and the adoption of aquaponics technology in Colombia. We use an embedded case-study design incorporating a qualitative and exploratory approach and employ two categories of fish-farming production systems as units of analysis. We triangulate our findings using non-probability sampling techniques and use our findings as a benchmark to discuss the potential adoption of aquaponics technology. Our findings suggest that fluctuations in rainfall and drought are the most important climate variables influencing negatively fish farming activities. Furthermore, we find that the complex institutional structures involved create unequal informal mechanisms among fish-farming production systems. We argue for context-specific designs when considering the adoption of aquaponics and conclude that, while fishfarming production systems encounter these external forces differently, heterogeneity also exists within systems, revealing intricacies worth considering.},

Consequently, this study showed individual functions of these two different Hydroponic culture subsystems from new established dates no significant differences at the 7th test date, until increasingly significant difference for the Hydroponic culture subsystem of Floating Raft is less effective than Hydroponic system of Pumice Bed based on the height of shoot, length of petiole and width of leaf on the 14th test date and the height of shoot, length of petiole, length of leaf, the number of leaf and length of root on the 21st test date. Nonetheless, Hydroponic subsystems did not support the growth and productivity of the Water Spinach varieties in all stages of testing about statistical significance. In addition, in term of productivity criteria and growth criteria on the 7th, 14th and 21st dates of testing, no significant difference were observed between two Water Spinach varieties. Finally, the advice of the study does not choose the treatment [Floating Raft Hydroponic culture subsystem and Kangkung Unggul BikaR variety] due to the poor result for the height of the shoot, length of petiole and reality of yield of Kangkung Unggul BikaR variety are probably at the 21st test date.},

In a study estimation, there will be 9 billions of people by the year of 2050 and the majority of us which will live in urban environment. Most of the land is shifting to urban and industrial. More countries will not be able to meet the high demand of food consumption. Rapid urbanization and population growth issuess will henceforth cause food shortage problem. Therefore, every economic must plan and build sustainable ecological urban infrastructural to protect environment. Architecture design solution has a big influence to the environment. So, this dissertation is conducted to review on how permaculture full cycle eco-system (PFCE) can be integrated into urban environment for the purpose of creating a selfsustain community which can solve these issues. It will be introduced by way of vertical development in order to protect the biosphere and further to achieve a sustainable society. The aquaponic system (AS) is introduced into building to develop a new lifestyle and it is able to form self-sufficient community with increasing job opportunities and food production. The entire community live, work and consume at the same place. Literature review based methodology is applying in the study process. Case studies have been choosen based on integration level of permaculture aquaponic system in building architecture. This study explore on how the aquaponic system bring food closer to living and henceforth create a self-sustain scheme that can increase financial resource and improve the environmental and living condition. A real sustainable community scheme start from life-style which is a more holistic appraoch to take care and protect the environment. Knowledge of permaculture can achieve different types of sustainability according to its function of adaption through different approach and integration level.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic production combines intensive production with waste recycling and water conservation. Aquaponic join recirculating aquaculture with hydroponics to use nutrient waste from aquaculture as an input to plant growth. Traditional aquaculture systems treat or dispose nutrient-rich wastewater. In aquaponics, the waste products from the fish are converted by a bio-filter into soluble nutrients which are absorbed by the plants, and allow “clean” water to be returned back to the fish. Thus, it produces valuable fish protein with a minimal pollution of fresh water resources, while at the same time producing horticultural crops. Fish in aquaponic production systems can be raised in ponds, tanks, or other containers. Plants are grown separately in hydroponic tanks, submerged in water but suspended in gravel, sand, perlite, or porous plastic films, as well as on floating rafts. Systems vary greatly in design and construction, but most perform the following key functions: finfish and plant production, removal of suspended solids, and bacterial nitrification. This review discusses applications, effects and perspective of aquaponics.},

An experiment with a completely randomized design was run with two treatments in triplicates, 1) an aquaponic system without use of zeolite as a control group and 2) use of a small cotton bag, containing 10 g zeolite as a bed medium for planting a lettuce seedling. In each experimental unit, 42 seedlings of lettuce were introduced. The individual weight of fish and lettuce yield in treatment 2 was significantly higher (P{$<$} 0.05) than treatment 1 at the end of experiment. The initial mean individual weight of red tilapia juveniles was 6.23 ± 0.06 g and increased to 32.50 ± 2.00 and 37.50 ± 2.20 in treatments 1 and 2, respectively by the end of experiment. The yield of lettuce was higher in treatment 2 (1507 ± 445.00 g/unit) compared to the control (275 ± 83 g/unit). The concentration of total ammonia-N in the water was significantly lower (P{$<$} 0.05) in treatment 2 compared to treatment 1 at the end of experiment. The concentration of phosphorous and potassium in the fish rearing tanks was significantly lower (P{$<$} 0.05) in treatment 2. These results indicated that the use of zeolite, as a bed medium to plant lettuce seedlings in a recirculating aquaponic system could increase the growth of lettuce seedlings as well as improving water quality parameters.},

  abstract = {Effects of supplementary nutrient in the production of red tilapia (Oreochromis sp) and Lettuce (Lactuca sativa var longifolia) evaluated in a representative water recirculating aquaculture system. The nutrient solution supplemented was 25\% level of (L25) nutrient solution as medium used for aquaponic production of lettuce in the NFT system (based on cooper’s formula). Thus, a completely randomized experimental design conducted with two treatments in triplicates (Pl25 and PL0). Six black rectangular tanks (114 x 86 x 100cm) used as fish culture tanks and each one equipped with three hydroponic troughs. Each tank filled with 640 L of water and aerated continuously with two circular air stones (3 L min-1) during the experiment. The system was efficiently able to remove high rate of total ammonia -nitrogen (TAN) excreted by fish during the experiment. The fish attained marketable size (200g) during a 110 –day period. Nutrient supply had not significant effects (p{$>$}0.05) on growth of fish during experimental period. The yields (Biomass/tank) of fish in treatments PL25 and Pl0 were 9.97 and 9.26 kg / tank, respectively. Three times cultivation and harvest of lettuce carried out during the experimental period. At the first harvest, the yield (mean wet weight) of lettuce showed significant (p{$<$}0.05) differences between treatments, 1437g and 85 g in treatments PL25 and Pl0, respectively. In the second and third lettuce harvests, the yield of lettuce did not show any significant differences (p{$>$}0.05) and averaged 2112 and 1419 (Second harvest) and 1173 and 807 (Third harvest) for treatments PL25 and PL0, respectively. It was recorded that red tilapia could tolerate 25\% of nutrient solution, used for aquaponic production of lettuce, and introduction of nutrient solution to the culture system is necessary to get higher yield of lettuce at initiation of culture system.},

  abstract = {Urban farming through aquaponics has begun in Semarang, since 2016. More than eighty people formed an aquaponics community. The community has conducted routine training on aquaponics to develop urban farming through this system. But the number of aquaponics was unstable. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to find out the motives and dynamics of the aquaponics community in supporting urban farming. The method of this research used a qualitative approach. The results of studies with the analysis of the theory of motives and group dynamics show that this community was in the class of altruism and collectivism motivation so that it has a chance of sustainability even though at certain moments it decreases. As for the dynamics of some actors who think that they weren’t in line with expectation, factors emerge that weaken the community in aquaponic. However, those who have altruism and collectivism motives will tend to survive because they got personal satisfaction and a good impact on their environment. Therefore, when many actors leave this system, they keep trying to return to carry out aquaponic activities in support of urban farming in Semarang.},

This study used a completed randomized factorial design which consisted of two factors. The first factor were the larvae from females broodstocks without MT injection (0 μg/g body weight) (A), injected with MT (1 μg/g body weight) (B), and injected with MT (2 μg/g body weight) (C), while the second factor were larval stocking densities of 3.000/ m2 (V1) and 6.000/m2 (V2), with three replications. The results showed that the larvae from female broodstocks injected with MT 2 μg/g body weight (C) and stocking densities 6.000/m2 (V2) increased the aggressiveness of swim and decreased cannibalism. The highest cannibalistic behavior occurred from 00.00–06.00.},

  abstract = {The integrated production of fish with water-born plants (hydroponics) is one of the most promising aquaculture (known as ‘aquaponics’) systems that is embraced around the world. Therefore, a study was conducted in triplicate for a period of forty days using 20L plastic containers to observe the growth performance of catfish (Heteropneustes fossilis) and money plant (Scindapsus aureus) in an aquaponics treatment system (hereafter ‘T1’) and compared these results with monoculture of fish (T2) and plant (T3) in other treatments. Almost equal sized and aged juvenile catfish (total length: F1,38=1.66, p = 0.20) were collected from a hatchery which were randomly assigned to T1 and T2, while similar sized single branched money plants (stem length: F1,22 =1.28, p = 0.27) were collected from the local market which were randomly planted into T1 and T3. Water quality parameters (e.g. temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, etc.) were monitored regularly which did not show any significant variation as well as any deleterious effect on the growth of fish and plants. After the experimental period, the results showed that the final weight of T1 catfish (aquaponics) was significantly higher than T2 treatment group (monoculture). In case of plant, total leaf number (p = 0.005), total leaf area (p = 0.0007) and total plant biomass (p = 0.011) of T1 group (aquaponics) were significantly higher than those of T3 group (monoculture). The result suggests that the integration Asian stinging catfish with money plant provides a new avenue for sustainable fish food production along with hydroponics.},

Combination from those two system could create synergism to maximize the effects from both system. This study aims to determine the effect of molasses addition on feed conversion ratio (FCR) and water quality (TAN, nitrite and nitrate) of catfish rearing by biofloc-aquaponic system. This experimental study was carried out for 30 days using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of four treatments with five replications. Those four treatments are based on the difference in the amount of molasses added. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan multiple range test (DMRT). The results of this study indicate that the different addition of molasses is able to bring a positive effect on FCR and water quality in the catfish rearing using bioflocaquaponic system with the lowest FCR obtained by P3 (1.33) and the lowest nitrogenous waste obtained by P2 but the FCR were not significantly different with P3.},

Tilapia is an important commercial fish because of its fast growth, tolerance to environmental conditions and diseases, possibility of intensive culture, low costs of production and marketable flavor. Production of aquatic and agricultural crops in an aquaponic system would ask these expectations. Aquaponic system that includes combination of hydroponics and water recycling systems was examined for modulated culture of tilapia and agricultural crops at the present study. Tilapia fries with 6.2 g and 5.9 g mean weight and stocking density of 40 m3 were respectively stocked in two 2.5 m3 tanks at September 2013 for 9 months. Fish culture in the two tanks tended to 17.2 kg/m3 and 19 kg/m3 fish production with 658 g and 596 mean final weights, 98\% and 100\% survival and 1.4 and 1.6 food conversion rates. Plants were implanted using grow beds, floating rafts and nutrient film methods. Monthly production of mint, basil, lettuce, cucumber, tomato and pepper were 1.14, 0.5-0.8, 1.32, 2.7-4, 2.03-3.4 and 1.1 kg/m2 crops, respectively.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the combined culture of fish and hydroponic plants in recirculating systems. Aquaculture effluent provides most of the nutrients required by plants if the optimum ratio between daily feed input and plant growing area is maintained. An experiment was conducted in an outdoor, commercial-scale aquaponic system on 0.05 ha of land in the tropics. The objectives were to determine the production of tilapia and basil using batch and staggered cropping systems, compare aquaponics with field crop production and evaluate the ratio of feed input to plant growing area. The projected annual production of tilapia was 4.37 t. The mean yield of basil was 2.0, 1.8 and 0.6 kg/m2 using batch, staggered and field cropping systems, respectively. Projected annual production of the system was 5.0 t of basil with staggered production. Nutrient deficiency symptoms appeared only in the batch-cultured basil. The feed input ratio was 81.4 g/day/m2 for batch culture and 99.6 g/day/m2 for staggered production. Staggered production moderated the uptake of nutrients. Basil production is sustainable in an aquaponic system with a feed input ratio of 99.6 g/day/m2 and a staggered cropping system.},

  abstract = {A commercial-scale, aquaponic system for the intensive production of tilapia and hydroponic vegetables has been developed at the Virgin Islands Agricultural Experiment Station. The system is well suited for Caribbean islands and other tropical regions where fresh water is scarce or level farm land is limited. It consists of a fish rearing tank, a clarifier, two hydroponic tanks and a reservoir, and is reliable, productive and easy to operate. Water continuously circulates between the fish and hydroponic components. The fish grow rapidly on a pelleted diet that is high in protein. Waste from the fish provides most of the nutrients required by vegetables. The vegetables recover these nutrients as a valuable by-product and purify the water. The presence of both fish and plants creates a very stable growing environment, while high nutrient levels and unlimited water promote rapid vegetable growth. This system is economical because nutrient costs are reduced, the need for expensive filtration devices is eliminated, component operating and infrastructural costs are shared, land requirements are small, water is conserved, and environmental impacts are minimized.},

  abstract = {A 200-m3 circular tank was evaluated in production trials stocked with sex-reversed Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) at 20 and 25 fish/m3 in Trial 1 and 2, respectively. Water treatment methods consisted of aeration, water circulation (mixing), solids removal and nitrification in the water column. The fish were fed ad libitum twice a day with a complete (32\% protein), floating pellet. After 175 and 201 days of growth, total production was 14.4 and 13.7 kg/m3 in Trial 1 and 2, respectively. Ammonia and nitrite concentrations were generally acceptable for tilapia growth. The nitrate-nitrogen concentration increased throughout the trials and reached 654 and 707 mg/L in Trials 1 and 2, respectively, which indicated a high rate of nitrification and the need for a denitrification treatment process to be added to this closed system. Total suspended solids (TSS) increased throughout the trials and reached peaks of 1,300 and 1,960 mg/L in Trials 1 and 2, respectively. The horizontal water velocity was too high for effective sedimentation of suspended solids for removal by a cone situated in the center of the tank. The addition of an external clarifier to the system for the last 3 weeks of Trial 2 removed 360 kg of dry weight solids, resulting in the reduction of TSS levels from to 1,700 to 600 mg/L. The reduction of TSS improved other water quality parameters and fish feeding response.},

  abstract = {Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) provide multiple benefits in agriculture by enhancing crop productivity and nutrient content and suppressing the growth of pathogens. Development of beneficial plant-microbe interactions based on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomic data of both PGPB and host will lead to optimized microbial inoculants for enhancing crop yield and nutrient content. PGPB are promoted as a green technology which will reduce the use of chemical fertilizers thereby improving soil health. Although a significant increase in the use of PGPB in agriculture was observed in the last two decades, there is a dearth of long-term studies addressing the effects of PGPB on existing microbial community structure. It is likely that most or all PGPB are resistant to common antibiotics used to treat human diseases. Antibiotic resistance of PGPB may be due to the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and intrinsic resistance due to the presence of efflux pumps. The biological significance of resistance to antibiotics and metals and their relation to plant growth promoting activity, if any, is not known. The consequences of harboring antibiotic resistance may be negative if the trait is transferred to other soil or environmental bacteria. Strategies to develop PGPB strains with useful traits of plant growth promotion but without resistance to common antibiotics used by humans, would enhance agricultural productivity without the negative effects on the environment. Alternately, harboring antibiotic resistance may be positive if it is due to intrinsic resistance involving proteins which also have other functions. Antibiotic resistance of PGPB may be an essential trait if it is related to their plant growth promoting activity. Overall, there is a need to conduct large-scale screening of PGPB for antibiotic resistance and long-term studies to see the effect of the introduction of biofertilizers on native soil microbial community.},

Tossa jute (Corchorus olitorius) leaf was selected to utilize this unexplored nutritious resource rather leaving under water for potential pollution. Three isonitrogenous test diets were prepared and applied as treatments (T) in triplicates (R). In control (T0) dietary inclusion rate of fish meal was 30\%, of which 10\% was substituted with jute leaf powder in T10 and in T20 replacement was 20\%. Mrigal fingerlings (9.38±0.13 cm and 7.94 ±0.26 g) were stocked in nine plastic half drums (0.26 m2 each) at 10 fish per drum and fed test diets. Although, growth parameters among the treatments were statistically similar, the highest mean length gain, weight gain, SGR and production were 1.51 (±0.18) cm, 2.96 (±0.13) g, 0.53 (±0.03) \%/day and 4084.00 (±50.67) kg ha-1, respectively in T10. However, significantly higher (P{$<$}0.05) survival was found in T10 (93.33\%) and T20 (90.00\%) compared to T0 (83.33\%). Juveniles in T10 and T20 showed better tolerance to low pH stress than T0. Water quality parameters were within acceptable range in all the treatments. Moreover, carcass composition of fish was statistically similar among the treatments. Importantly, feed formulation cost was reduced by 3.7\% and 20.4\% in T10 and T20, respectively compared to T0. Therefore, the results signify that jute leaf powder could be a promising substitute of fishmeal in mrigal diet without hampering growth along with improved survival and low feed cost.},

Substitution of traditional farming system with cost effective integration of different production units has emerged as potential solution. In this regards, aquaponics has already put back the traditional farming systems in facing the burning issues of food safety. The experiment was designed to make a comparison of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) production between aquaponics (T1) and traditional soil growbeds (T2) in laboratory condition at the Aquaponics Laboratory, Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh. Each of the treatment has three replications that were placed randomly. A Seven hundred fifty liter water tank was set for fish rearing where 50 tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and 20 magur (Clarias batrachus) fry were released. Tilapia was fed with commercial floating feed while magur with sinking feed. Six (44×26×24 cm3) containers, three for each treatment, were used for lettuce sapling plantation. The fish waste water was irrigated into aquaponics beds and then returned to the fish tank as the thumb role of aquaponics. Fish, plants, water and soil quality parameters were sampled fortnightly, analyzed chemically in the aquaponic laboratory. The results revealed that the performance of T2was better than the T1 in terms of lettuce growth in respect of plant height, leaf number, plant and root weight. Lettuce production was comparatively higher in T2 (123.25 tons/ha/89 days), than T1 (107.89 tons/ha/89 days). This might be attributed to the higher nutrient content of the traditional soil (T2). At The end of the experiment, the survival rates were 96 and 80\% for tilapia and magur respectively whereas the total productions were 47.33 and 4.19 tons/ha/105days respectively. Further research needed to ascertain the superiority of these systems in food production.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a food production system that combines aquaculture with hydroponics. The simultaneous existence of fish, beneficial bacteria and plants in the same water loop predisposes the fish and bacteria to a possible detrimental effect of plant protection products. Additionally, there is an inadequate exploration of scientific studies on the impact of pesticides on fish and bacteria in aquaponics systems. This study investigated the effects of three commercial insecticides based on the following active ingredients: pyrethrum, azadirachtin, and spinosad, on aquaponics systems. Due to ethical concerns in animal testing, applying insecticides directly to aquaponics setup was impossible. Therefore, three separate experiments were conducted: (1) Pesticide runoff rate – in which insecticides were applied to basil (               Ocimum basilicum               ) plants grown in two hydroponic systems: media bed and floating raft. The concentrations of applied insecticides were measured in the water of nutrient solutions of the hydroponics after 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96h to establish a pattern of degradation of insecticides. The result from this experiment showed that pyrethrum and spinosad were detected in unquantifiable concentrations in the nutrient solutions. Hence, further experiments were conducted only with azadirachtin. In a biofilter trial (2) – azadirachtin, at three concentrations (1.5 µg L               -1               ; 7.5 µg L               -1               ; and 15 µg L               -1               ), was added to a running biofilter to investigate the effects on nitrifying bacteria. Mild effects were recorded in the nitrification and bacteria microbiome. In the third trial (3) – Nile tilapia (               Oreochromis niloticus               ) were exposed to similar concentrations of azadirachtin for seven days (and the same period for recovery) to investigate effects on fish hematology, blood biochemistry, antioxidative enzymes in the brain, gills, muscle, liver and intestine and histopathology of gills and liver. Results showed mild effects in hematology and biochemistry profile in fish and higher levels of lipid peroxidation in the liver during the exposure. The results indicate a safe use of pyrethrum and spinosad in aquaponics setup, while azadirachtin has to be used with care, especially in coupled aquaponics systems.},

  abstract = {Even though aquaponics is the production system that is increasingly gaining focus, there is an absence of publications studying the use of pesticides in the aquaponics. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess negative effects of one synthetic (chlorpyrifos) and two botanical insecticides (azadirachtin and pyrethrin) to matured biofilter in plastic buckets. The effectiveness of biofilter bacteria is determined indirectly, as concentrations of ammonia, nitrites and nitrates in the water were measured at 0h, 5h, 13h, 21h, 29h, 37h, 45h and 53h after insecticides application. The results showed negative effects of azadirachtin on the first step of nitrification, as concentration of ammonia was higher comparing to other groups for almost every sample point. Negative effects on second step of nitrification and higher concentrations of nitrites in the water were also detected, but no statistical differences were observed in the present study, due to the large variation between buckets. Nitrates were lower in water treated with azadirachtin from 29 hours from start to the end of the experiment. Application of other two insecticides to biofilter did not cause any effects and showed no difference comparing to the control group.},

The experiment was set-up for 8 weeks under 4 treatments with three replications, where stocking density of tilapia were 30, 50, 70 and 90 fish/tank (300 litre) in treatments T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively. Water from the tank was recirculated through a vegetable growing tray. Each of the tray was 0.15 m3in size, which was planted with 12 plants (Indian spinach). The fish of all the treatments was fed two times a day. During the experimental period,the range of water temperature was 27.1 to 31.50 C, pH 7.48 to 8.28, ammonia 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l and dissolve oxygen 5.11 to 6.58 mg/l. At the end of the experiment, average weight gain, final length, specific growth rate (\%/day), survival rate was significantly higher in T1 (30 fish/tank) treatment while the net yield of fish and plant biomass was higher in T2 (50 fish/tank) treatment.Therefore, the study suggests that stocking density of 50 fish/tank for tilapia, i.e. 167 fish/m3, is suitable for production of both plant and fish in a recirculating aquaponic system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics systems combine vegetable cultivation with fish culture (Rao et al., 2017). Several environmental factors influence water quality, among which dissolved oxygen is the most critical. The dissolved oxygen-related processes are nonlinear and unstable and are characterized by considerable time delays and time variances. In an aquaponics system, the dissolved oxygen content is affected by changes in the aquaculture water and in the greenhouse climate. Understanding the changes in dissolved oxygen and ensuring its stability requires effective prediction approaches and corrective measures. Traditional prediction methods are characterized by low stability, low accuracy and poor timeliness. A dissolved oxygen prediction model based on fuzzy neural networks is proposed in this paper. With a large number of inputs, the fuzzy network has high dimensonality, a complex model structure, and low precision, among other limitations. A genetic algorithm can be used to optimize the centre and width of the fuzzy neural network's middle layer and determine the optimal parameter combination, thus improving the efficiency and predictive accuracy of the model (Liu et al., 2014). The results show that a fuzzy neural network optimized using a genetic algorithm is more stable, more accurate, and more suitable for predicting dissolved oxygen than a fuzzy neural network and backpropagation neural network in an aquaponics system. Predicting dissolved oxygen is critical to the stability of an aquaponics system.},

Mexico, one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to natural disasters, has been applauded by leading international DRR figures for its commitment and practical response to DRR. The article explores this DRR response and what Mexico’s story has to offer to other countries in the context of SSC and its emerging role in international development cooperation (IDC). It argues that Mexico’s DRR story has many important positive aspects to contribute to SSC knowledge-sharing and IDC, but it also illustrates continuing challenges of financing, administration, and politics for emerging and developing economies alike.},

Aquaponics technique, on the other hand, is a farming method that combines a recirculating aquaculture system and soilless hydroponics agriculture promising to be one of the answers to sustainability in the food industry. Lack of intelligent real-time approaches to monitor and track plant growth is hindering the transition of aquaponic systems towards automation and commercialization. Computer vision can promote further contributions in smart applications in aquaponics; therefore, a methodology is pro­ posed to measure in real-time the growth rate and fresh weight of crops in multi-instance setups. The proposed system uses image-processing techniques, deep learning, and regression analysis to estimate the size of the crops as they grow using image segmentation. Then, a correlation between the size of the crops and their fresh weight is modelled. For common little gem romaine lettuce, the size of crops and fresh weight is estimated with an overall error of 30 mm (18.7\%) and 0.5 g (8.3\%), respectively.},

For postlarvae, using brackish water can maintain high survival ({$>$}85\%), but only in initial culture which lasts for 50 days. For the fattening of adult males, culturing in separate containers conditioned in various levels improves the survival (87–100\%) and yield (1.0 kg m−2), and with this system, the culture is also performed with tilapia.

  abstract = {Water and nutrient savings can be established by coupling water streams between interacting processes. Wastewater from production processes contains nutrients like nitrogen (N), which can and should be recycled in order to meet future regulatory discharge demands. Optimisation of interacting water systems is a complex task. An effective way of understanding, analysing and optimising such systems is by applying mathematical models. The present modelling work aims at supporting the design of a nearly emission-free aquaculture and hydroponic system (aquaponics), thus contributing to sustainable production and to food security for the 21st century. Based on the model, a system that couples 40 m3 fish tanks and a hydroponic system of 1,000 m2 can produce 5 tons of tilapia and 75 tons of tomato yearly. The system requires energy to condense and recover evaporated water, for lighting and heating, adding up to 1.3 GJ/m2 every year. In the suggested configuration, the fish can provide about 26\% of the N required in a plant cycle. A coupling strategy that sends water from the fish to the plants in amounts proportional to the fish feed input, reduces the standard deviation of the NOÀ3 level in the fish cycle by 35\%.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a technique that combines aquaculture with hydroponics, i.e. growing aquatic species and soilless plants in a single system. Commercial aquaponics is still in development. The main challenge consists in balancing the conditions required for the growth of multiple species, leading to dynamic a system with high complexity. Mathematical models improve our understanding of the complex dynamics in aquaponics, and thus support the development of efficient systems. We developed a water and nutrient management strategy for the production of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) in an existing INAPRO aquaponic demonstration system in Abtshagen, Germany. This management strategy aims for improved water and nutrient efficiency. For this purpose, we developed a system-level mathematical model and simulation. In our simulations, we found that the existing configuration and water management of the Abtshagen aquaponic system results in an excessive amount of water discharged from the RAS. Therefore, sending more nutrient-rich water from fish to plants can help reducing water and fertilizer consumption. However, this water transfer may lead to excess concentrations of some nutrients, which could stress fish, plants or both. For the Abtshagen system, our simulations predicted excess concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) for the fish, and sodium (Na+) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) for the plants. Furthermore, our simulations predicted excess calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) for plants, due to the use of local fresh water with relatively high concentrations of those ions. Based on our simulations, we developed an improved management strategy that achieves a balance between resource efficiency and water quality conditions. This management strategy prevents excess levels of TSS for fish, and Na+and NH4+-N for plants. Under the improved management strategy, simulated water requirements (263 L/kg fish and 22 L/kg tomato) were similar to current commercial RAS and greenhouse horticulture. Simulated fertilizer requirements for plants of N, Ca and Mg (52, 46 and 9 mg/kg tomato, respectively) were one order of magnitude lower than in high efficient commercial closed greenhouse production.},

  abstract = {The use of automation, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and smart technologies is being rapidly introduced into the development of agriculture. Technologies such as sensing, remote monitoring, and predictive tools have been used with the purpose of enhancing agriculture processes, aquaponics among them, and improving the quality of the products. Digital twinning enables the testing and implementing of improvements in the physical component through the implementation of computational tools in a ‘twin’ virtual environment. This paper presents a framework for the development of a digital twin for an aquaponic system. This framework is validated by developing a digital twin for the grow beds of an aquaponics system for real-time monitoring parameters, namely pH, electroconductivity, water temperature, relative humidity, air temperature, and light intensity, and supports the use of artificial intelligent techniques to, for example, predict the growth rate and fresh weight of the growing crops. The digital twin presented is based on IoT technology, databases, a centralized control of the system, and a virtual interface that allows users to have feedback control of the system while visualizing the state of the aquaponic system in real time.},

  abstract = {La espinaca es una planta de alto valor nutricional, mostrando gran acogida en su presentación “baby”. La producción en hidroponía está limitada por la solución nutritiva, siendo la acuaponía un potencial complemento a este factor limitante. El objetivo de esta investigación fue definir los cambios de niveles de nutrientes en la solución hidropónica en espinaca baby. Se trabajó con 24 plántulas de espinaca en hidroponía de cama flotante usando solución “La Molina” en tanques de 50 L; se realizaron 5 repeticiones y 3 réplicas. Para cada réplica se cosechó cada tres semanas, registrando semanalmente variables fisicoquímicas de la solución. Además, se llevó a cabo un muestreo al inicio y final de cada réplica, evaluando las siguientes variables: número y longitud de hojas, área foliar, peso fresco y seco de la parte aérea. Se obtuvo en orden descendiente la siguiente extracción de macronutriente: N{$>$}K+{$>$}Ca2+{$>$}P y micronutrientes: Mn2+{$>$}Fe2+. Durante el ciclo de cultivo el pH de la solución osciló entre 6.00-6.97, el oxígeno disuelto entre 4.93-7.54 mg/L y la conductividad disminuyó constantemente a lo largo del ciclo, inició en 1558-1592 μS/cm y finalizó entre 1140-1275 μS/cm. Se obtuvo un TCC= 0.00002-0.00003 g/cm2/día; TRC=0.16, 0.15 y 0.14 g/g/día y TAN=0.006, 0.005 y 0.006 g/cm2/día para las réplicas 1, 2 y 3, respectivamente. Este estudio revela que esta planta podría tener buenos rendimientos en un sistema acuapónico, especialmente por los requerimientos de N, Ca2+{$>$}P, no obstante, se deberían adicionar bajas cantidades de algunos micronutrientes, que suelen ser escasos en los sistemas acuapónicos.},

  abstract = {Agriculture in urban and urbanizing areas will be increasingly critical to enhancing food security and food sovereignty, creating income, strengthening social interactions, and improving health outcomes in cities. We used three roofs, a hydroponic system, an aquaponic system, and field rows in an urban environment to grow six dwarf tomato cultivars: ‘Micro Tom’, ‘Red Robin’, ‘Sweet ‘n’ Neat’, ‘Terenzo’, ‘Tiny Tim’, and ‘Tumbler.’ We measured the marketable yield and non-marketable yield, mass of non-marketable tomatoes exhibiting defects, and the content of 12 mineral nutrients in fruits. We found the productivity often varied among cultivars within a cropping system. ‘Terenzo’ and ‘Tumbler’ were always some of the most productive cultivars, whereas ‘Micro Tom’ was normally among the least productive cultivars. The production from ‘Red Robin’, ‘Tiny Tim’, and ‘Sweat ‘n’ Neat’ was more variable, sometimes producing high, moderate, or low mass. The mineral content was especially variable across the cultivars and we did not identify cultivars that were consistently high or low in mineral content across systems, indicating that the mineral content was highly influenced by a genotype x environment interaction. The amount of 5 minerals differed across cultivars in aquaponics, 9 differed in hydroponics, and 6–12 differed in the roof systems. A high-yielding cultivar should be selected first and production methods can then be modified to maximize the nutrient content.},

Whether they arise from someone's garage or are created within a mature Fortune 500 organization, new ventures, by definition, are designed to create new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainly. Their primary mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls "validated learning" about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a product-centric approach, Lean Startup prizes testing your vision continuously with your customers and making constant adjustments"--},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an alternative method of food production that confers advantages of biological and economic resource preservations. Nonetheless, one of the main difficulties related to aquaponics systems could be the outbreak and dissemination of pathogens. Conventional treatments need to be administrated carefully because they could be harmful to human, fish, plants and beneficial microorganisms. Aquaponics practitioners are relatively helpless against plant diseases when they occur, especially in the case of root pathogens. Biological control agents (BCAs) may be an effective alternative to chemical inputs for dealing with pathogens of plants under aquaponics systems. Research of BCAs on aquaponics systems is limited, but there are numerous publications on the use of BCAs to control plant pathogens under soilless systems which confirm its potential use on aquaponics systems. The present review summarized the principal plant pathogens, the conventional and alternative BCA treatments on aquaponics systems, while considering related research on aquaculture and soilless systems (i.e., hydroponic) for its applicability to aquaponics and future perspectives related to biological control. Finally, we emphasized the case that aquaponics systems provide relatively untapped potential for research on plant biological control agents. Biological control has the potential to reduce the perturbation effects of conventional treatments on microbial communities, fish and plant physiology, and the whole function of the aquaponics system.},

Thus, the fish feed needs to fulfil both the fish’s and plant’s nutritional requirements in an aquaponic system. A controlled fish waste production strategy where the nitrogen, phosphorus and mineral contents of fish diets are manipulated and used provides a way of influencing the rates of accumulation of nutrients, thereby reducing the need for the additional supplementation of nutrients. To optimize the performance and cost-effectiveness of aquaponic production, fish diets and feeding schedules should be designed carefully to provide nutrients at the right level and time to complement fish, bacteria and plants. To achieve this, a species-specific tailor-made aquaponic feed may be optimized to suit the aquaponic system as a whole. The optimal point would be determined based on overall system performance parameters, including economic and environmental sustainability measures. This chapter thus focuses on fish diets and feed and reviews the state of the art in fish diets, ingredients and additives, as well as the nutritional/sustainable challenges that need to be considered when producing specific aquaponic feeds.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the development of Lactuca sativa in hydroponic and aquaponic systems (with Rhamdia quelen) with or without bioflocs using minimal infrastructure. Hydroponic (H-system), aquaponic (Aqua), and aquaponics with bioflocs (Aqua-BF) were evaluated in a randomized design. It did not use a greenhouse, and it used a single tank to produce vegetables and fish together. The stocking density of lettuce was 20 plants m-2. A total of 168 R. quelen juveniles were used to Aqua and Aqua-BF. Total ammonia, nitrite, and turbidity of the water were higher to Aqua-BF than H-system and Aqua. Lettuces were significantly more productive in Aqua and Aqua-BF than H-system. There were no differences between Aqua and Aqua-BF for the parameters lettuce production and fish performance. Under the conditions of this study, it was possible to conclude that aquaponic farmers can use silver catfish, and aquaponic systems with and without bioflocs can improve the lettuce produce. The use of bioflocs in the aquaponic system may improve the productivity but needs a better study to optimize and simplify this technology.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics combines raising fish and growing plants by recycling water and nutrients to reduce water consumption and reliance on chemical fertilizers. Coupled aquaponics systems recirculate water between fish and plant crops, whereas decoupled systems send mineralized fish effluent and wastewater unidirectionally to an independent hydroponic loop. Decoupling enables changes to the water, such as pH adjustments and complementary nutrient additions, to promote plant performance. In this study, basil, Ocimum basilicum (L.), was transplanted into 4 L containers filled with decoupled aquaponic (DAP), nutrient-complemented decoupled aquaponic (DAP+), or chemical-based conventional hydroponic (CON) nutrient solutions and grown for 21 days at pH 5.8. Plants grown in DAP+ and CON had greater biomass, height, and Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) chlorophyll index and lower root:shoot biomass ratios than those in DAP. Shoot fresh and dry biomass was 11\% greater for CON than DAP+, while height, SPAD chlorophyll index, and root:shoot ratio did not differ. We concluded that added nutrients in DAP+ enhanced performance compared to DAP, and the biologically derived nutrition in DAP+ enhanced performance to be similar, but not equal, to CON. We cannot recommend specific adjustments to the targeted blend of complementary nutrients tested, but findings suggest that complementary nutrients are effective in decoupled aquaponics.},

  abstract = {Organic vegetables produced in greenhouses and other controlled environments may fill a unique market niche as consumers demand local, high vegetables year round. However, limited technical information supports these production systems and more research is needed to provide recommendations for appropriate substrate mixes and nutrient management. Compost can be used as a substitute for peat-based media, and research results vary widely based on feedstock, compost method, and proportion used in mixes. Most studies consider compost in terms of peat-substitute or replacement and not as a source of fertility in soilless systems. Common challenges in using compost in soilless media are due to immaturity of the compost, poor water holding capacity, and unbalanced salinity and pH. It is possible to certify organic soilless production systems; however, the National Organic Program (NOP) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has not yet provided clear rules and requirements supporting these systems. The objective of this article is to review the literature on soilless organic vegetable production, summarize results from the more widely studied topic of vegetable transplant production, and point to future research for organic agriculture.},

  abstract = {A major bottleneck to sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) storage root production is obtaining enough “slips,” which are the initial planting material. Some evidence suggests aquaponics can yield more plants than in soil, but none is available on slip production. In this study, the growth, mineral composition, total phenol, and antioxidant capacity in I. batatas cuttings were compared when grown aquaponically or terrestrially in soil. The aquaponic system housed catfish that were fed twice daily while soil-grown I. batatas cuttings received daily applications of a commercial fertilizer. Results showed that from nine I. batatas cuttings, these became nine slips in soil after 3 weeks compared to 55 slips in the aquaponic system. The mean length, weight, and number of nodes were all significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.05) in aquaponics while the stem diameters were similar between treatments (p {$>$} 0.05). Both the total phenol and antioxidant capacity in the I. batatas leaves were significantly higher in soil. Manganese and zinc were both significantly higher in leaves when grown aquaponically, but no significant difference in iron, phosphorus, or magnesium was detected. Results demonstrate that aquaponics provides vastly superior I. batatas slip production, but the implications of the altered mineral composition and total phenol/antioxidant when the slips are later planted in soil should be explored.},

  abstract = {Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) is an advance method of aquaculture which combines species with different nutritional needs to live together. The combination between aquatic live and crops is called aquaponics. Aquatic waste that normally removed by biofilters in normal aquaculture practice will be absorbed by crops in this practice. Aquaponics have few common components and growbed provide the best filtration function. In growbed a siphon act as mechanical structure to control water fill and flush process. Water to the growbed comes from fish tank with multiple flow speeds based on the pump specification and height. Too low speed and too fast flow rate can result in siphon malfunctionality. Pumps with variable speed do exist but it is costly. Majority of the aquaponic practitioner use single speed pump and try to match the pump speed with siphon operational requirement. In order to remove the matching requirement some control need to be introduced. Preliminarily this research will show the concept of fill-and-flush for multiple pumping speeds. The final aim of this paper is to show how water level management can be done to remove the speed dependency. The siphon tried to be controlled remotely since wireless data transmission quite practical in vast operational area. Fog architecture will be used in order to transmit sensor data and control command. This paper able to show the water able to be retented in the growbed within suggested duration by stopping the flow in once predefined level.},

Currently aquaponic system is the only solution for fish and plants production but one unique challenge is the maintaining of micro and macro-nutrient and the pH balance in the system. The study was conducted at the University of Eldoret for 119 days. A complete randomized design was used. The supplementation rates in fish diets constituted 30g, 20g, 10g and 0g Fe kg-1 respectively. Nile tilapia fry with a mean weight of 0.475 ± 0.025g and nine spinach (height 3 ± 0.131cm, 2 leaves) were stocked in 12 aquaria in an aquaponic system. 30g Fe kg-1 treatment exhibited higher minerals content than other treatments with Phosphorus 67.51 ± 2.42 mgL-1, Zinc 9.06 8± 0.45 mgL-1, Iron 5.2 ± 0.218 mgL-1, Manganese 7.655 ± 0.344 mgL-1, Total Nitrogen 11.248 ± 0.141mgL-1 and Sodium 7.218 ± 0.028 mgL-1. There was improved water quality at 30g Fe kg-1 compared to other treatments. These results revealed that 30g Fe kg-1 iron amino acid chelate supplementation had better nutritional attributes as feedstuff for spinach growth than the three other dietary treatments. The study recommends the incorporation of 30g Fe kg-1 iron amino acid chelate in on-farm formulated diets for aquaponic system where complete diets are not easily accessible for small scale farmers.},

The results showed that overall growth was significantly increased by foliar Fe application, and the highest values of vegetative growth parameters were recorded in plants treated with FeSO4. The Fe treatment led to a significant increase of shoot Fe concentration, and the highest Fe was observed in plants sprayed with FeSO4, compared to Fe-EDTA and Fe-EDDHA. The lowest chlorophyll content was observed in untreated plants. The highest SPAD index, maximal quantum yield of photosystem (PS II) photochemistry (F-v/F-m) and performance index (PI) values of young and old leaves were found with FeSO4 treatment. It is concluded that application of foliar Fe must be performed in the aquaponic system, to overcome Fe deficiencies in alkaline conditions.},

  abstract = {Due to recent droughts in Iran and other parts of the world and consequently limited water resources, tending to aquaponic system, in which fish and plants grow together, is a logical and practical method. For this reason, in the current experiment, possibility of mint planting in aquaponic system and the effects of applying nano-fertile fertilizer containing 60\% humic acid on its growth was investigated. Mint rhizomes were planted in pure-perlite-contained pots and after reaching trnsferable stage, the plants were transferred to course-sand medium of aquaponic system. Nanofertile fertilizer concentrations for foliar spray were 0 (control), 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/L, with 100 mL for each treatment. Foliar application was continued every week, for 6 weeks, and the plants were harvested after 60 days. Results showed that all concentrations of foliar spray of mint plants with nano-fertile fertilizer increased fresh and dry weight of shoot and root as compared to control. Nano-fertile fertilizer increased chlorophyll content, soluble sugars, Fv/Fm, and PI as compared to control plants. Plant growth enhancement and better physiological conditions of nanofertile sprayed plants were correlated with higher potassium, phosphorus, calcium, iron, manganese and copper content in shoots of the treated plants. Therefore, considering higher concentration of some nutrients and chlorophyll content in the leaves of plants treated with nano-fertile fertilizer and consequently higher photochemical quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and photosynthesis performance index (PI), it is concluded that nano-fertile-treated plants had a better photosynthesis condition and thus carbon fixation was carried out well, dry matter was increased and plant growth was improved.},

  abstract = {An experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of foliar applications of different Fe sources on pepper plants grown in alkaline aquaponic solutions. Common carp was stocked in the rearing tanks at 50fishm-3. The fish were fed three times daily with a pellet diet containing 46\% protein. Twenty days old pepper seedlings were transplanted on to growth bed units of aquaponic system after stocking of carp fish for 2 months in the rearing tanks. Foliar nutrients application began 30 days after transplantation. Four treatments were used, untreated control, foliar application at the rate of 200mLplant-1with 0.5gFeL-1FeSO4, Fe-EDTA, and Fe-EDDHA. Plants were sprayed twice a month. The results showed that overall growth was significantly increased by foliar Fe application, and the highest values of vegetative and reproductive growth parameters were recorded in plants treated with FeSO4. The lowest chlorophyll content was observed in untreated plants. The highest SPAD index, maximal quantum yield of PS II photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and performance index (PI) values of young and old leaves were found with FeSO4, with no difference between Fe-EDTA and Fe-EDDHA treatments. The Fe treatment led to a significant increase of shoot Fe concentration in pepper plants, so that the highest shoot Fe concentration was observed in plants sprayed with Fe-sulfate, whereas Fe-EDTA and Fe-EDDHA led to intermediate concentrations and control led to the lowest one. Foliar fertilization of pepper plants with different Fe sources had a beneficial effect on the essential nutrient uptake and transport in plants. Thus, present results revealed that application of foliar Fe must be performed in the aquaponic system, to overcome Fe deficiencies in alkaline conditions and to make better nutritional status. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper revisits the data–information–knowledge–wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy by examining the articulation of the hierarchy in a number of widely read textbooks, and analysing their statements about the nature of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The hierarchy referred to variously as the ‘Knowledge Hierarchy’, the ‘Information Hierarchy’ and the ‘Knowledge Pyramid’ is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and ‘taken-for-granted’ models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff’s original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts.},

  abstract = {The study was conducted to see the feasibility of raft aquaponics in polyculture pond. Three experimental ponds (with an area of 5.2, 3.12 and 3.12 decimal) were selected where the third one was considered as control pond. Locally available cheap materials were used in preparing rafts, e.g., bamboo splits, iron wire, plastic thread and disposable plastic water bottle. Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), pudina (Mentha arvensis), brinjal (Solanum melongena), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), giant taro (Alocasia macrorrhiza) and Indian spinach-red (Basella rubra) saplings were planted in the raft. Pond 1 and 2 were found to be covered with 4.12\% and 2.56\% with raft vegetable respectively. The percentage of specific growth rate (SGR) per day for Pangas (Pangasius hypophthalmus) was 2.57, 1.27 and 2.36 but it was found to be 0.822, 0.795 and 0.438 for Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in ponds 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For both fishes, the highest growth was found in pond 1. The production from each raft for pudina, water spinach and okra was about 266.7, 333.3 and 66.7 g respectively. Only pudina production was well enough to get benefit from raft vegetable culture and benefit-cost ratio of pudina production was about 7.82. In the study period giant taro showed good growth. Fruits and flowers were observed in Indian spinach-red and brinjal respectively at the end of the study period. Brinjal plants was affected by disease and tomato plants did not survive in the pond condition due to algae and other fouling clog on the roots which prevented nutrients up take from the pond water.},

  abstract = {The increasing population in the world forces humans to improve farm yields using advanced technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one promising technique to achieve precision agriculture, which is expected to greatly increase yields. However, the large-scale application of IoT systems in agriculture is facing challenges such as huge investment in agriculture IoT systems and non-tech-savvy farmers. To identify these challenges, we summarize the applications of IoT techniques in agriculture in four categories: controlled environment planting, open-field planting, livestock breeding, and aquaculture and aquaponics. The focus on implementing agriculture IoT systems is suggested to be expanded from the growth cycle to the agri-products life cycle. Meanwhile, the energy concern should be considered in the implementation of agriculture IoT systems. The construction of green IoT systems in the whole life cycle of agri-products will have great impact on farmers’ interest in IoT techniques. With the life cycle framework, emerging finance, operation, and management (FOM) issues in the implementation of green IoT systems in agriculture are observed, such as IoT finance, supply chain and big data financing, network nodes recharging and repairing, and IoT data management. These FOM issues call for innovative farm production modes and new types of agribusiness enterprises.},

The net present values of annual cash flows over a 10-year planning horizon were determined for barramundi and lettuce production as stand-alone units, and alternatively as integrated units, using a capital budgeting framework. Integrated production enables barramundi effluent to be used as a source of nutrients for the lettuce production. This results in an increase in net benefits equal to the reduction in barramundi effluent disposal costs, and the saving of some water and nutrient costs of the lettuce system.},

To maintain a good water quality and to produce quality and healthy fishery products, the systems depend on a diverse microbial community involved in different processes of water purification but also in unwanted effects. The article reviews the present knowledge on microorganisms in RAS, their relative distribution within the system compartments and their role in system performance. The system possesses different microniches in which microorganisms retrieve their preferential conditions for oxygen and nutrients. Ammonia and nitrite are oxidized under aerobic conditions into less toxic compounds. Anaerobic ammonium oxidizers in the biofilm oxidize anaerobically both ammonia and nitrites into less harmful dinitrogen gas. Heterotrophic bacteria mineralize organic matter derived from uneaten feeds, dead bodies and excreta of fish. Under conditions of high organic load and high C/N content, nitrifiers are overgrown by heterotrophs with negative effects to the nitrification process. For not yet understood reasons, the presence of off-flavour-producing microorganisms occurs also in RAS. Microbial management and management of inputs to the systems to prevent the proliferation of pathogens are discussed and possible management techniques of off-flavours are also presented. Research orientations are given to explore further the potential of heterotrophic bacteria in microbial management and intensive aquaculture production in systems other than RAS.},

The techniques produce high food yield, but are nontrivial to implement, needing careful monitoring of pH, temperature, and other parameters. This paper presents the design and initial prototype testing of a complete photovoltaic-powered aquaponics system developed for the Hidden Creek Opportunity Center (HCOC) in Little Rock, AR. The goal of this system was twofold: to provide a sustainable business and educational opportunity for the clients of the HCOC, and to prototype a customizable unit which could be deployed worldwide to provide food and business opportunities in developing nations. The system was designed to meet multiple criteria: off-grid photovoltaic power (for worldwide use), full greenhouse enclosure (for longer growing season), modular components (for easy repair or customization), automated controller (with data collection and internet connectivity to aid remote troubleshooting), vertical column growing tubes (to minimize environmental footprint), and total system cost of less than \$3,000. The design and data reported here will be beneficial for the next generation of inexpensive, robust, sustainable, and easy-to-use aquaponics systems.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics fits into the integrated agri-aquaculture systems (IAAS). However, IAAS applies many different aquatic animal and plant production technologies in many contexts, whereas aquaponics is far more tightly associated with integrating tank-based fish culture technologies (e.g. recirculating aquaculture systems- RAS) with aquatic or hydroponic plant culture technologies. The green gram was cultured to test their yield efficiency in three different hydroponic subsystems viz., Media Bed System (MBS), Floating Raft System (FRS) and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) whereas the freshwater fish Oreochromis mosssambicus was cultured in Aquaponic system. The nutrients were supplied from fish culture tank while plant stripped nutrients from the wastewater before it was return to the fish. Fish O. mosssambicus biomass was gains well and green gram Vigna radiata yield were good. The biomass gain and yield of both the crops was noticed in the following order: MBS{$>$}FRS{$>$}NFT with the significant difference was observed between all treatments. The NFT treatment was significantly lesser than the other two treatments in the case of (nitrate removal) whereas in other test treatments temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen was shown no significant differences. The overall results conclude that the MBS aquaponics is more suitable in yielding fish biomass and plant yield when compared to FRS and NFT aquaponics system.},

Selection of practical solutions is then required whilst considering technical, environmental, socio-cultural, and financial factors. In this study, a multi expert decision support tool that considers a variety of evaluation criteria is proposed to provide a ranking system for competing advanced WWT technologies in terms of their performance. Two scenarios of water reuse in the contexts of Brazil and Greece are defined, and evaluation is undertaken based on opinions of water reuse experts. The results prove that the tool would successfully facilitate rigorous and methodical analysis in evaluation of WWT technologies for water reuse applications with potential for use under various sets of evaluation criteria, WWT technologies and contexts.},

For this reason, many highly pollinator-dependent crops are nowadays pollinated artificially by humans. Here, we compared the efficiency of artificial and bee pollination practices on the mean level and stability of pollination and fruit production of kiwifruit. In a kiwifruit orchard, we tagged a total of 800 flowers from 40 plants, half were pollinated by honeybees while the other half by spraying pollen on flowers, the most commonly pollination technique used in kiwifruit. During harvest, we measured fruit set, number of seeds per fruit, and fruit weight. On average, bee-pollinated plants produced 40\% more fruits than artificially-pollinated plants. Also, fruits from bee-pollinated flowers contained, on average, 34\% more seeds, showing also 2.8 times less variability in number of seeds per fruit than those pollinated artificially. Following the same trend, bee-pollinated flowers produce fruits that were 34\% heavier and 1.5 times less variable in weight. These results showed that bee pollination resulted in higher fruit production, and heavier and more homogeneous fruits than artificial pollination. According to these results, we encourage growers and land managers to use pollination management practices based on honey bees, instead of the use of mechanical pollination systems.},

  abstract = {Traditional agricultural systems are challenged by globally declining resources resulting from climate change and growing population. Alternative agricultural practices such as aquaponics (includes crop plant and aquatic species) and hydroponics (includes crop plant only) have the potential to generate high yield per unit area using limited land, water, and no soil. A soilless agricultural study was conducted at the Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, USA from August to November, 2015. The growth, yield, quality, and nutrition of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultivar Aroma 2, were compared between aquaponic and hydroponic systems using crayfish (Procambarus spp.) as the aquatic species. Non-circulating floating raft systems were designed using 95 L polyethylene tanks. Equal amounts of start-up fertilizer dose were applied to both systems. The objective was to understand how the additional nutritional dynamics associated with crayfish influence the basil crop. Both fresh and dry basil plant weights were collected after harvest, followed by leaf nutrient analysis. Leaf chlorophyll content, water pH, nitrogen and temperature were measured periodically. Aquaponic basil (AqB) showed 14\%, 56\%, and 65\% more height, fresh weight, and dry weight, respectively, compared to hydroponic basil (HyB). It is logical to assume that crayfish waste (excreta and unconsumed feed) has supplied the additional nutrients to AqB, resulting in greater growth and yield. The chlorophyll content (plant quality) or leaf nutrients, however, did not differ between AqB and HyB. Further research is needed to investigate aquaponic crayfish yield, overall nutritional dynamics, cost-benefit ratio, and other plant characteristics under soilless systems.},

  abstract = {The population of Bangladesh is increasing tremendously and to keep pace with the increasing demand of fish protein, farmers intensified fish production from the water bodies which created environmental pollution. To tackle the situation the raft and rack aquaponics experiment was conducted to reduce the water pollution and have vegetable production from high density poly-culture fish ponds. Three ponds were selected each having an area of 3.12 decimal. The bamboo made raft was placed on water surface and rack on the bank of pond 1 which denoted as treatment T1 and only raft was placed in pond 2 that noted as treatment T2 and pond 3 was without any raft and rack denoted as control (T3). Summer vegetables were planted in both the rafts and rack in two liter plastic water bottles. The vegetable growth and water quality parameters such as NH4/NH3, NO3, NO2, PO4, DO and pH were measured fortnightly using test kits. Pungasius and tilapia were released as the experimental fishes at the rate of 33,650 and 16,000 fish/ha. Data interpretation showed that \% SGR per day of pungasius and tilapia in T1, T2 and T3 were 2.57 and 0.822, 1.27 and 0.795, 2.36 and 0.438 respectively. The highest growth was found in T1 treatment for both species. The water quality parameters were within the accetpable limits but were significantly different among the treatments. The water quality in T1 and T2 tresatments were better than the T3. The production of water spinach, pudina and okra from raft and rack were about 997 and 2460; 797 and 1969; 199 and 492 kg/ha/90days respectively in T1. In T2 only okra production was higher than T1 (215kg/ha/90days) but water spinach and pudina production was lower than T1 (923 and 763 kg/ha/90days). The pudina production was highly profitable than the other crops and benefit-cost ratio of pudina was about 6.33. So, along with the fish culture, farmers can produce vegetable through raft and rack aquaponics and can improve the pond condition. The technology can be piloted in different agro-ecological zones in the country.},

To feed the enormous population, farmers increased crop production using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides which created environmental pollution and health hazards. Therefore, an experiment was carried out as organic farming to investigate the growth performances of Taro plant (Colocasia esculenta) in aquaponics system (T1), hydroponics with tap water (T2) and in soil (T3). The healthy and equal sized Taro seedlings were used in each method and tilapia was used as experimental fish. Water quality parameters were recorded weekly, fish and vegetable growth was monitored fortnightly and soil quality was measured monthly. Two sample t-test was conducted for morphological parameters and coefficient of variation (CV) was measured for biochemical elements to find out the best performed method. The growth of Taro plant was significantly different in various systems. The highest growth was found in T1 followed by T3 and T2. The mineral contents in the soil were significantly higher than the other systems. Taro plant growth was significantly higher in T1 as waste water continuously supplied nutrients to the plants, hence, the system can be replicated anywhere in the country irrespective of geographic location and weather to overcome the environmental pollution.},

A colour composite Landsat TM image from 1996 covering the southwestern part of Bangladesh was used to identify the extent of brackish water and to classify land use. The remotely sensed data were complemented by secondary data digitised from a range of sources, including hard copy maps, to create a spatial database that included environmental and infrastructural data. A series of GIS models were developed in order to identify and prioritise the most suitable areas for brackish water shrimp and crab farming. Using qualitative and quantitative output from the models, the benefits of shrimp and crab farming and alternative land uses in the Khulna region were compared, based on gross production, economic output and employment potential. Comparisons were made of brackish water shrimp and crab culture with moderately saline-tolerant tilapia and prawn culture, freshwater carp culture and traditional rice production systems. Shrimp was identified as the most capital intensive and risky production system. Earnings per hectare were a little higher for shrimp culture than for crab culture. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of GIS as an aquaculture planning tool in a region where natural resources are already under considerable pressure.},

For this farmers use a huge amount of water, feed and chemicals which depleted underground water, creates air and water pollution and hazards on environment as well as on human health. An attempt made to introduce aquaponics system for fish and vegetable production through deceiving aquaculture wastes. The aquaponics systems such as media based system for taro and tomato and nutrient film technique for water spinach used to see the effectiveness of nutrient trapping and vegetable grown in lab and field conditions. Tilapia was the experimental fish in all the systems for its hardy nature. Fishes fed pellet feed twice at 10\% gradually it is decreased at 5\% of their body weight. Fish tank water irrigated with a mini pump to the systems which then return to the fish tank. The denitrifying bacteria convert the wastes into nutrients for the vegetables and made the water clean for fish before return to the tank again. All the experiments gave better performance than the control. The tomato production cycle in aquaponics system was longer and less disease prone than the control. Farmers of experiment area accept this technique willingly and their perception on aquaponics performances is good. The experiments showed that nutrient recycling is not a luxury reserved for rural areas with space limitation; instead, the additionally occupied surface generates income by producing marketable goods. By converting nutrients into biomass, treating wastewater could become a profitable business in third world countries.},

  abstract = {The effluents of traditional shrimp monoculture cause pollution and promote eutrophication and hypernutrification of the receiving coastal ecosystems. Integrated aquaculture and a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) have been proposed as an alternative to address these problems. In this study, we developed a dynamic model to simulate the concentration of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite, and nitrate in an integrated culture of whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, and seaweed, Gracilaria vermiculophylla, in a recirculating and zero water exchange system, and the effect of nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria was also included. The experiments demonstrated that a dynamic model can explain the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and variations in these concentrations over time in the integrated culture. The results also suggest that nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria play an important role in the transformation of dissolved nitrogenous compounds; therefore, these bacteria should be considered within the dynamics of nitrogen in integrated systems with low water exchange.},

Since the appearance of the product generally determines whether a product is accepted or rejected, measuring the color characteristics becomes an important task. To carry out the analysis of this key attribute for agriculture, it is recommended to use an artificial vision system to capture the images of the samples and then to process them by applying colorimetric routines to extract color parameters in an efficient and nondestructive manner, which makes it a suitable tool for a wide range of applications. The purpose of this chapter is to give an overview on recent development of image processing applied to color analysis from horticultural products, more specifically the practical usage of color image analysis in agriculture. As an example, quantitative values of color are extracted from Habanero Chili Peppers using image processing; the images from the samples were obtained using a desktop configuration of machine vision system. The material presented should be useful for students starting on the field, as well as for researchers looking for state-of-the-art studies and practical applications.},

Due to this, the agriculture land is decreasing that results less food production and cannot supply necessary food for the increased population. The people already experience this problem during COVID-19 pandemic. The vertical agriculture is ideal solution that introduced to ensure food security. In this form of soilless agriculture, we use controlling environment to monitor plant growth, to record pH and EC levels daily, to test for disease detections, to supply water with required nutrients and to check CO2 concentration. In this paper, we observed that plant intakes changing at various stages such as germination, vegetative, reproduction and maturity stages. We proposed enhanced and costeffective techniques for supplying all essentials of plants as much as they required according to their stage. We introduced two methods 1. To identify the vegetative stage based on plant height 2. To identify the reproduction stage using R-CNN algorithm. This helps to inform the farmer let to know the changes in plant stages in right time.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic is a combination system between aquaculture and hydroponic, which is water-use efficient and is suitable to be developed in the archipelagic dryland. This study aimed to determine the effect of adding probiotics in fish feed and the use of clam (Pilsbryoconcha exilis) as additional components in the aquaponic system on feed conversion ratio, productivity of catfish (Clarias gariepinus) and aquatic spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), and removal efficiency of organic matter suspended in the aquaculture water. This study was an experimental study using a factorial treatment laid out in a completely randomized design, with three replications. The treatments applied were administration of probiotics with concentrations of 2 ml kg-1, 4 ml kg-1, and 6 ml kg-1 in feed to improve feed efficiency in catfish, thus minimizing metabolite discharges, and the use of clam in biofilter systems with a density of 50 clams m-2, 100 clams m-2, and 200 clams m-2 to improve the efficiency of absorption of cultivation effluents in the form of suspended particles. The results of ANOVA showed that the treatment of adding probiotics in the fish feed had a significant effect (P{$<$}0.05) on improving feed conversion ratio, increasing the production of catfish, and the removal efficiency, but had no significant effect (P{$>$}0.05) on aquatic spinach biomass production. Whereas the use of clams as biofilter significantly (P{$<$}0.05) improved feed conversion ratio, increased the production of catfish and aquatic spinach, also efficiently removed organic matter in the aquaponic system. The interaction of these two factors had a significant effect (P{$<$}0.05) on feed conversion ratio and aquatic spinach production, however, it had no significant effect (P{$>$}0.05) on the production of catfish and the organic matter removal efficiency. Post hoc LSD test showed that the best interaction effect was the treatment of probiotic 6 ml kg-1 and biofilter 200 clams m-2 because it generated a combination of the lowest feed conversion ratio (1.07) and the highest of aquatic spinach production (5.28 kg m-2).},

  abstract = {In the expanding urban agriculture phenomenon in Europe, home gardens are a traditional form that have kept agriculture within cities, even becoming crucial in certain historical periods (e.g., war periods). However, horticultural practices in home gardens can also have negative consequences. The goal of this paper is to assess the eco-efficiency of home gardens as a type of urban agriculture. To do so, a case study in Padua (Italy) was evaluated following life cycle assessment and life cycle costing methods. A home garden of 30.6 m2 and 21 crop cycles were evaluated. The functional unit of the assessment was 1 kg of harvested fresh vegetable at the consumption point, and the ReCiPe method was employed for impact assessment. Environmental assessment indicated that organic fertilization, use of tap water, mineral fertilization and pesticides were the most contributing elements of the entire life cycle. Furthermore, the relevance of garden design and crop selection was a determinant in the eco-efficiency results. The assessed home garden could satisfy the food requirements of between 1 and 2 members of the household. Crop management and design recommendations are provided to improve eco-efficiency and food security potential of home gardens.},

  abstract = {Jelbuk sub-district has 39.30\% stunting incidents, which are the highest stunting rate in Jember Regency, Indonesia. Most residents in Jelbuk are farmers who are jobless while waiting the harvest season. Hence, a community-based aquaponic project was created to uplift the community income and reduce stunting incidents in Jelbuk. This paper aims to identify the mechanism of community-based aquaponic project in Jelbuk. This study is qualitative by taking data through interview, observation, and literature review. Aquaponic is the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics where fish and plants grow in one integrated system. Implementing this project requires cooperation among stakeholders, such as healthcare centers, farmer groups, and government. Having the aquaponic system, the community can consume and sell fish and vegetable products to increase their income and reduce the stunting incidents.},

Theweight and length of fish at the time of stocking were 1.44 ± 0.12 gand 3.92 ± 0.09 cm respectively. The growth and production of fish and bell pepper were significantly higher in the biofloc integrated aquaponic(BFT-AQP) units compared to clear water aquaponics system (AQP).The water quality parameters like dissolved oxygen (6.54 ± 0.05 mgL− 1) and nitrate-N (5.26 ± 0.49 mgL− 1) were high in control compared to treatments. Significantly higher specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio for fish reared in T1 (2.03\% day− 1 and 2.31, respectively) followed by T2 (1.79\% day− 1 and 2.18, respectively).The results revealed that fishes reared in integrated system showed significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) lower stress parameters especially in treatments T1 and T2 as compared to control.The present study concluded that the integration of biofloc system with aquaponics can be recommended for better production of GIFT strain of tilapia, maintaining a stocking density of 150 no.m− 3 for ideal production of bell pepper, without creating any stressful environment for fish.},

It consists of four fish rearing tanks (5 m-3 each) and four raft hydroponic troughs (29 m-2 each). To test commercial feasibility of aquaponics under the climatic conditions of Alberta the food fish tilapia was selected in combination with several conventional greenhouse plants (cucumber, tomato, etc.), herbs, medicinal plants, and nutraceutical plants. A protocol was developed for producing aquaponic crops in Alberta. More than 60 different crops and varieties were tested in a greenhouse. Based on this preliminary evaluation, 24 crops (five greenhouse vegetables and 19 herbs) were grown in trials to determine production levels. Yields of tomatoes and mini-cucumbers reached 20.7 kg plant-1 year-1 and 33.4 kg plant-1 year-1 and exceeded average values of commercial greenhouses in Alberta that employ conventional hydroponic technology. During the 2-year study, the yield of Genovese basil increased from 13 kg m-2 year-1 to 42 kg m-2 year-1 as production and harvesting methods were refined. This study demonstrated the technical feasibility of the aquaponic technology in Alberta. Evaluation of the economic feasibility is under way.},

The system included: a) Hydroponic unit, b) Aquaponic unit, c) Pilot plant for wastewater treatment, d) Home composter. Lettuce crop was used throughout the research to compare its yield under different agricultural systems. In this regard, lettuce was planted in hydroponic and aquaponic systems, whereas, conventional cultivation of the same crop was performed using direct irrigation with hydroponic solution, direct water effluent from fish rearing tank and effluent from wastewater treatment plant, in addition to control trial using fresh water and fertilizers. Lettuce production in each trial was evaluated using different parameters. The obtained results showed that hydroponic system is the most efficient one, where fast production with little resources could be achieved. Nevertheless, and even acceptable results were obtained in aquaponic system, it was clear that more attention should be applied as fish is affected by the surrounded ambient factors, mainly the temperature. Also, the wastes produced by fish may need more time to be degraded, or does not contain all nutrients needed by plants, thus hinder their growth. Both systems used around 80\% less water than growing in soil, which is important especially with the scarcity of water resources for agricultural sector.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is technology developed from the aquaculture industry that integrates intensive farming of fish and utilizes plants (integrates hydroponics) in a continuous closed loop to clean the water for the fish. The plants clean the water of nitrate (waste form is initially ammonia) which has been converted into a form that is not toxic to fish by bacteria and is accessible to plants. Hydroponics technology is a technique used to grow plants and vegetables that does not incorporate soil, but nutrients that are dissolved in water and plants are either floated or treated with a nutrient film delivered to the roots by a variety of processes. These technologies are becoming more popular with communities and governments as the preservation of water becomes more of an issue in environments where water is becoming restricted in supply and has to be supplemented by mechanical means such as desalination, which comes at additional cost to consumers. The technologies have had a great amount of research interest to find parametres and ranges that the systems require to function successfully yet also remain productive with certain crop varieties. The successful diversification of crop varieties could increase the viability of commercial aquaponics, which could be achieved with the use of optimized advanced process control strategies.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics operators that have transitioned from hobby to commercial operators have commonly failed to meet commercial expectations. One of the reasons for failures is the occurrence of severe technical errors. Unexpected events can often have drastic financial consequences on new operators, which could be initially operating within tight margins. Standard techniques like Hazard and Operability studies (HAZOP) are conducted by process and chemical industries to do systematic analysis on a process and its sub-systems. Many aquaponics operators are not familiar with these design processes and find design inadequacies after an event, which normally has financial consequences. This design process is able to identify disturbances that could lead to product deviation and identify hazards that could affect the environment. Identifying process issues and designing engineering controls to prevent or mitigate issues can be carried out in multiple forms or design tools. Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) is one such tool in a designer’s toolbox and is recognized as an international standard (IEC 60812), which describes techniques to analyze processes that can effect the reliability of a process plant or determine what possible hazards could be present. The use of FMEA has been utilized by industries to aid in carrying out HAZOP design processes, the use of these design processes can lead to inherently reliable processes. Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams also referred to as Process and Instrumentation Diagram (P\&ID) are used in the process industry to show an overview of the process plant. The P\&ID also identifies instruments that could be required for measurement and any associated alarms that are present to warn operators and mitigate failures in the process. The use of these design tools have identified and mitigated the risks within the initial design concept to prevent these technical errors with engineering controls designed into the process.},

The system was designed to increase the layers of control over the inputs and outputs to operate the system with a process control approach. The viability of these levels of control over the process was investigated by undertaking a processes design to assess types of instrumentation required and control functions that could be incorporated into the design to optimize the process. The design process incorporated sub-systems that did not rely on a main system, to increase ranges of commercially viable crops. The subsystems do not have the same environmental requirements of the main system and the subsystems environment could be calibrated to meet specific requirements of a selected crop including fruiting vegetable types. The results of the automation design have been tabulated into this article to assess the viability of increased levels of process control to obtain subsystem designs with maximized optimization.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a system that integrates aquaculture with plant production in which two species are benefited, and there is water saving. In this study was carried out with an aquaponic system to verify the interaction between the growth of the halophytes Batis maritime, Sarcocornia neei, and Sporobolus virginicus associated with white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei rearing. We also investigated if there were different responses of physicochemical variables of the water in the experimental shrimp culture ponds integrated into the growth of plants and control ponds, without plants, throughout a 56-day period. The treatment experiment and control presented a statistically significant difference in total dissolved solids, salinity, total suspended solids, ammonia, orthophosphate, and nitrite. In the experimental treatment, with the presence of plants and recirculating water, a reduction of total suspended solids, ammonia and orthophosphate was observed. The rate of shrimp production was not significantly different between treatments, and the performance was similar to that of other studies. The biomass gain of the halophyte B. maritima was 876.6 grams in 0.5 m² and of S. neei was 48.8 grams in 0.16 m². All plants of the species S. virginicus died during the experiment.},

  abstract = {Background: An aquaponic system couples cultivation of plants and fish in the same aqueous medium. The system consists of interconnected compartments for fish rearing and plant production, as well as for water filtration, with all compartments hosting diverse microbial communities, which interact within the system. Due to the design, function and operation mode of the individual compartments, each of them exhibits unique biotic and abiotic conditions. Elucidating how these conditions shape microbial communities is useful in understanding how these compartments may affect the quality of the water, in which plants and fish are cultured. Results: We investigated the possible relationships between microbial communities from biofilms and water quality parameters in different compartments of the aquaponic system. Biofilm samples were analyzed by total community profiling for bacterial and archaeal communities. The results implied that the oxygen levels could largely explain the main differences in abiotic parameters and microbial communities in each compartment of the system. Aerobic system compartments are highly biodiverse and work mostly as a nitrifying biofilter, whereas biofilms in the anaerobic compartments contain a less diverse community. Finally, the part of the system connecting the aerobic and anaerobic processes showed common conditions where both aerobic and anaerobic processes were observed. Conclusion: Different predicted microbial activities for each compartment were found to be supported by the abiotic parameters, of which the oxygen saturation, total organic carbon and total nitrogen differentiated clearly between samples from the main aerobic loop and the anaerobic compartments. The latter was also confirmed using microbial community profile analysis.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics combines hydroponic crop production with recirculating aquaculture. These systems comprise various compartments (fish tank, biofilter, sump, hydroponic table, radial flow settler and anaerobic digester), each with their own specific environmental pressures, which trigger the formation of unique microbial communities. Triplicated aquaponic systems were used to investigate the microbial community composition during three lettuce growing cycles. The sampling of individual compartments allowed community patterns to be generated using amplicon sequencing of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. Nitrifying bacteria were identified in the hydroponic compartments, indicating that these compartments may play a larger role than previously thought in the system's nitrogen cycle. In addition to the observed temporal changes in community compositions within the anaerobic compartment, more archaeal reads were obtained from sludge samples than from the aerobic part of the system. Lower bacterial diversity was observed in fresh fish feces, where a highly discrete gut flora composition was seen. Finally, the most pronounced differences in microbial community compositions were observed between the aerobic and anaerobic loops of the system, with unique bacterial compositions in each individual compartment.},

Detailed examination of the data gave the first indications to functional groups of organisms in the different compartments of the aquaponic system.

Understanding N transformations within the context of agricultural systems is crucial for efficient use thereof. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in concentration of N forms (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate and organic N) within an aquaponic system, a modern agricultural system, in order to obtain insights into environmental pressures influencing N transformation processes. By measuring the concentrations of the individual N com­ pounds, complemented by the determination of abiotic parameters and other relevant nutrients within the system water at 13 sampling points, significant differences between compartments that build up an aquaponic system could be demonstrated. These differences were attributed to individual microenvironments specific to the aerobic loop, anaerobic loop and radial flow settler as a connection between the two, shaping the microbial processes within the aquaponic system.},

Different types of hydroponic systems have been used for growing crops in aquaponics. However, very few studies have compared their suitability and efficiency in an aquaponic context. The study presented here compares tomato yield, morphological (external) and biochemical (internal) fruit quality, and overall tomato plant vitality from three different HP systems (nutrient film technique, drip irrigation system, and floating raft culture) and examines the distribution of nutrients in different parts of the tomato plant. Three replicate AP systems were set up, each incorporating the three different HP systems coupled with a separate recirculating aquaculture unit growing Nile tilapia. The results showed that the choice of the cultivation system had little influence on most of the above-mentioned properties. Tomato fruit mineral content was found to be in similar range for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Zn as reported in the literature. Yield and fruit quality were similar in all three systems. However, the drip irrigation system did perform slightly better. The slightly higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of the fruits grown in AP in comparison to commercially produced and supermarket derived tomatoes might indicate a potential for producing fruits with higher health value for humans.},

This can have environmental advantages such as reducing land conversion and resource input and waste output through nutrient cycling. To support the dissemination of aquaponics, key stakeholders need to be appropriately informed about this production method, an aspect that has received little attention so far. In this pilot study, visual perception of information about aquaponics was explored using eye tracking combined with a questionnaire. The results show that people distinguish between aquaponics variants when evaluating aquaponics. A production system with a more natural appearance is preferred. Allocation of visual attention is linked to the specific information content and to the assessment of the naturalness of aquaponics production. The results of the present study could form a basis for further research, not only to make information about food production systems more appropriate but also to develop food production systems in a way that people become more aware of the sustainability aspects of production methods and its products.},

Physiologically relevant are the various glucosinolates, which possess positive health effects in form of their thio- and isothiocyanates. In an interdisciplinary project, we aim to develop a hydroponic, and finally an aquaponic, circulatory cultivation system and to study the health effects of watercress. In humans, there is a lack of data-based knowledge on potential beneficial health effects of watercress. Growth of watercress was followed during one season in an open-door hydroponic system. Watercress was also cultivated in the greenhouse in different substrates with different concentrations of nutrients and salt. The biomass production is strongly dependent on the temperature. The glucosinolate contents differ significantly during the growing season, especially during flowering. Watercress naturally grows in nutrientrich fresh waters, however, when cultivated at NaCl concentrations of up to 120 mM the gain in biomass is still high. In a human proofof-concept study, indications for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of fresh watercress were observed already after a single dose intake of fresh watercress (85 g). Further in vivo and in vitro studies are planned to study health beneficial effects of watercress and its metabolic activity.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic systems are becoming more prevalent and have led to accurate mass and energy balance models that allow nutrient utilization to be maximized and plant and fish systems to be coupled or complimentary. Such models still do not address the potential of using the plant side as both the primary nitrification system and as a sink for the nitrate being produced from the fish system. However, using the plants as the nitrification system for the fish waste requires a better understanding and quantification of the nitrification capacity of the plant system. A series of experiments were conducted using butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa, cv. Flandria) in deep water culture rafts. Plants were grown under two growing conditions and were evaluated based upon harvestable weight. Treatment 1 (H5) consisted of a standard hydroponic nutrient solution maintained at pH 5.8, while treatment 2 (A7) consisted of an aquaponic waste solution maintained at pH 7.0. The aquaponic conditions were created from a fish rearing system using koi (Cyprinus carpio) that was continuously recirculated between the designated plant tubs and the fish tank with an in-line bead filter to capture and mineralize fish solids. The total root surface area was not significantly different between treatments, but the ratio of root surface area to root fresh weight was different, suggesting that aquaponic roots are finer than hydroponic roots. Predictive equations were developed to correlate root surface area to shoot or root fresh weight, which can be used to design the nitrification component for a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), as part of an integrated aquaponic system.},

  abstract = {The growth of hydroponic vegetables cultivated in a greenhouse is influenced by the photosynthesis process. Sunlight, an important factor to grow crops with high productivity, is blocked by the plastic sheetings of the greenhouse roof and their cleanliness. A layer of dust can build up and needs to be removed. In the traditional method, cleaners have to climb onto the high-level roof and use brushes to clean the plastic sheets. It is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and the cleaners are prone to accidents. There is a need for some tools to clean the roof instead of cleaning by workers. Therefore, a cleaning robot for greenhouse roof is developed in this study. The light-weight frames of four sponge wiper blades are used to clean the roof sheetings in wet condition. The robot can move along the greenhouse via a guideway on top of the roof by a guiding module. The average moving speed that provide good cleaning quality is 1.3 meters per minute. The cleaning quality is very good and the dust can be removed by about 85-95\%. Additionally, the proposed cleaning robot helps the worker clean the roof efficiently without any damage to the plastic sheeting and it can clean the roof twice as fast as manual cleaning.},

  abstract = {In the present study, tilapia and basil production was performed in an aquaponic system developed with the integration of fish and plant production in the same culture environment. The variation of elements in the water was monitored and their effects on fish growth performance and feed utilization together with the plant growth were recorded. Triplicate groups of fish tanks were used in two different culture systems (recirculating-RS and aquaponic system-AS). The RS consisted of a water filtration unit whereas the AS was set with the incorporation of basil (Ocimum basilicum) production with the roots in water instead of soil, absorbing the discharge water from fish tanks through their roots. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with an initial mean weight of 5.65 g were introduced into both RS and AS systems and fed a commercial diet (50\% protein) for a period of 75 days. At the same time basil was set into the AS with roots in water, a photoperiod of 12:12 dark:light regime was applied for the monitoring of plant growth. Water physicochemical parameters were recorded in both culture environments throughout the study period. Based on the findings in both culture systems, at the end of the experiment, it was found that the variations of amonium (NH4), nitrite (NO2) and nitrate (NO3) recorded in the AS were lower then those measured in the RS culture unit.},

  abstract = {Many large-scale endeavors, especially the ones that need to be performed on an occasional basis, are performed on a de novo basis. Whether one is designing a spacecraft or a dam, or launching a sales campaign, each endeavor tends to have a life of its own. Very little knowledge, if any, is transferred from one business or engineering design endeavor to a successive one. This paper describes an approach that involves the acquisition of raw information from the keystrokes entered by the user while performing the primary activity. Such information is distilled to produce knowledge for future use, without imposing additional burden on human users involved in the first endeavor or the succeeding endeavors. The paper also describes a complementary approach that significantly reduces the time and effort spent by human beings in articulating their requirements, and specifically, in terms of delineating the indifference points among a set of feasible alternatives. Both these approaches have been validated in a complex multi-organizational situation related to spacecrafts. The approaches can be applied, either singly or jointly, to a broad class of business and engineering scenarios. They incorporate the notion of automated knowledge acquisition, discovery, management, and dissemination. The proposed approach is discussed in the context of supporting workteams that are distributed both on geographic and temporal basis, thereby creating a ‘‘24-Hour Knowledge Factory’’ environment.},

  abstract = {Channa striata is the one of the local comodity in West Kalimantan Province which has important economic value. The demand for Channa striata comes mostly from urban communities, while urban areas only have narrow land / yard. One of the techniques of fish cultivation in narrow land is the aquaponics system. Thus, Channa striata cultivation with the aquaponics system can increase the productivity of cork fish in urban areas. The purpose of this study was to obtain the optimal amount of stocking density in Channa striata culture with an aquaponics system with indicators of success namely survival and growth rate. This study lasted for 75 days, taking place at the Pontianak City Fish Agribusiness Farm. The study design used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 4 treatments and 3 repetitions, The stocking solid treatment used in this study is A: 40, B: 60, C: 70, and D: 50 tails / m2. The results showed that treatment A had a significant effect on the absolute growth rate of 12.85 gr followed by perlkuan D: 12.46 gr, B: 8.87 gr, C: 7.9 gr, while the best specific growth rate was needed at time A: 3.50\%, D: 3.44\%, B: 3.05\%, C: 2.91\%. The observation of life survival also has the same trend, namely the best treatment in treatment A: 95\%, D: 90\%, B: 70\%, C: 49\%. From the results of these studies it can be concluded that the higher the stocking density in aquaponics fish farming systems will have an impact on the growth rate and the survival rate of Channa striata with the best treatment, namely with stocking density of 40 fish / m2.},

Today, aquaculture production in Egypt is the largest in Africa with about one million tonnes per annum. In this review, different freshwater and marine fish species that are cultured in Egypt are reviewed; the most important species are the tilapias, followed by mullets and carps. Current practices for aquaculture in Egypt are highlighted, which include extensive, semi-intensive and intensive aquaculture systems, integrated aquaculture systems, aquaponics and rice-field aquaculture, desert aquaculture and mariculture. This review focuses on the constraints that threaten fast growing and sustainable development of aquaculture industry, such as production costs, availability of feed and seed, lack of current technologies for feed production and domestic regulations. Also, the future perspectives with regard to overcoming of these obstacles are presented.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an eco-friendly system for food production utilizing aquaculture and hydroponics to cultivate fish and crop without soil. It is an inexpensive symbiotic cycle between the fish and plant. In an aquaponic system, fish waste (ammonia) is fed into the plant bed which acts as a bio-filter and takes the nitrate which is essential to grow vegetation. The fresh new water is then returned to the fish enclosure to restart the cycle. A unique advantage of an aquaponic system is conserving water more effectively compared to traditional irrigation systems. Conservation of water is accomplished by recirculating water between the plant bed and the fish habitat continuously. Organic fertilization of plants using dissolved fish waste is the other benefit of aquaponics. Utilizing plants as a natural alternative to other filters, requires less monitoring of water quality. In our project, an aquaponics system was designed and built in Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies at California State Polytechnic University of Pomona. The future purpose of our project is finding an optimized situation for the aquaponics system to produce food and save water more efficiently and eco-friendly.},

Three different coagulants were tested to determine if coagulant choice impacts nutrient and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (cBOD5) leaching into the filtrate and the final composition of the bag-captured biosolids at the end of each period. If nutrient leaching into the bag filtrate could be minimized through coagulant selection, then geotextile bags could provide a convenient and effective method to dewater waste biosolids and provide them in a form that fish farmers could readily transport, store, or send for disposal.},

  abstract = {With the general objective of optimizing internal nutrient recycling, circular multitrophic food production systems, e.g., combining fish, plant, and insect larvae production, rely on the quality and composition of sustainable nutritional inputs. Therefore, differences in dissolved and solid nutrient excretion patterns produced by Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) reared in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) with 5\% daily water exchange and fed black soldier fly meal (BSFM), poultry by-product meal (PM), poultry blood meal (PBM) and fish meal (FM) as single protein sources were investigated to evaluate the potential for creating specific fish meal-free diets. Fish fed the FM and PM diet showed the significantly best (p {$<$} 0.05) and among each other similar (p {$>$} 0.05) growth performance (specific growth rate (SGR): 2.12 ± 0.04/2.05 ± 0.11; feed conversion ratio (FCR): 0.86 ± 0.03/0.92 ± 0.01), whereas the PBM diet caused significantly reduced performance (SGR: 1.30 ± 0.02; FCR: 1.79 ± 0.05) in comparison to the FM/PM diet as well as the BSF diet (SGR: 1.76 ± 0.07; FCR: 1.11 ± 0.05). The FM and PM diet resulted in a faster increase and significantly higher dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus levels, while the BSF diet caused faster accumulation and significantly elevated levels of dissolved potassium, magnesium, and copper. The PBM diet resulted in the feces with the significantly highest nutrient density (gross energy, crude protein, and amino acids) but overall much lower dissolved nutrient levels in the water. Results are discussed with regard to implications for developing circular multitrophic food production systems.},

  abstract = {Three hydroponic media crushed stones (T1), river stones (T2), and floating raft (T3) were compared in an aquaponic system with common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and mint (Mentha arvensis). Fish effluents were used as plant nutrients while plants filtered water by stripping off the nutrients before returning to the fish tank. Fish growth, plant growth, and water quality parameters were used to evaluate the suitability of three different media. Growth performance of common carp and mint followed the relationship of crushed stones {$>$} floating raft {$>$} river stones with significant difference observed among all treatments. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal varied significantly among different treatments. The maximum TAN removal was observed in T1 (77.13\%) followed by T3 (69.65\%), and the minimum removal was observed in T2 (48.82\%). Nitrate removal varied significantly among different treatments. The highest removal was observed in T1 (82.95\%) followed by T3 (68.04\%) and T2 (59.51\%). Removal of phosphate was significantly lower in T2 (50.12\%) when compared to T1 (67.85\%) and T3 (70.71\%). Biofilter performance (g m−3 day−1) of T2 (4.80) was significantly lower compared to T1 (7.13) and T3 (7.37). Crushed stone and floating raft were significantly efficient when compared to river stone medium in terms of nutrient removal and water quality maintenance for the fish culture. Considering all growth parameters, crushed stone media proved to be better when compared to other two media. Thus, medium selection could be a considerable factor when designing an aquaponic system.},

The mean growth of fish varied significantly among treatments showing higher growth in T4 and control followed by T3, T2 and T1. Survival rate was 100\% in all the treatments as well as control. Percentage weight gain, SGR (\% day-1) also showed the similar trend as that of growth showing T4 as better treatment immediately followed by T3 then T2 and T1. The system maintained favourable water quality throughout the experiment. The growth in T3 and T4 did not vary significantly and was higher than the T1, T2 and control. Also percentage length gain at the end of the trial was maximum in T3 and T4. The Chl (a+b) content in the control was higher than all the treatments whereas, T4 showed the maximum concentration among treatments followed by T3, T2 and then T1. Comparison of all the growth attributes and water quality parameters indicated that water circulation can be reduced to 12 hrs/day for economically effective aquaponics and can be considered as optimum water circulation period for goldfish production in aquaponic system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics, an integrated system with both hydroponic plant production and aquaculture fish production, is an expanding alternative agriculture system. Many key questions about the overall feasibility of aquaponic systems remain unanswered. Of particular concern for start-up and established producers alike are consumer perceptions and willingness to pay for aquaponic produce and fish. This study reports results and analysis of a consumer survey about perceptions and preferences for aquaponic-grown products that was conducted in Minnesota during Feb. 2016. Probit and ordered probit models are used to evaluate the probability of different consumer demographic segments having various levels of knowledge and perceptions about aquaponics. About one-third of respondents had previously heard of aquaponics, and upon learning more about the system through the survey, respondents tended to be generally neutral or favorable to aquaponics. Price might be an issue for many consumers, but many tend to believe that aquaponics can impact the environment in a positive way. The results represent a first step toward building knowledge about the potential consumer base for aquaponics, which is a critical piece in the system's potential overall profitability. It appears that consumer education and marketing will be key for the expansion of the market.},

A 2 × 3 factorial experiment consisting of 2 filtration regimes (unfiltered versus partially filtered pond water) and 3 aggregates (styrofoam as control, sand, and gravel). The hydroponic units were placed on a bamboo platform across the pond surface. An earthen pond (226 m2) was stocked with 8000 hybrid catfish with an average initial weight of 6.58 ± 1.72 g. The fish were fed with commercial pelleted feeds containing 30\% crude protein. Twenty-one days old lettuce seedlings were transplanted on to hydroponic units after stocking catfish for 4 months in the pond. Pond water was partially filtered by using a settling tank and filtration tank, which contained netting materials to trap solids. Lettuce plots were irrigated twice daily at 0800 and 1600 h using either filtered or unfiltered pond water for 45 min.},

In this study, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and pak choi (Brassica chinensis) culture was tested using two techniques: 1) Root floating (RAFT), and 2) Dynamic root floating (DRFT). Water quality parameters, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and phosphate were measured. At the end of the experiment, fish and plants were weighed and the required electric power consumption was calculated. There was no significant difference observed between the effect of each treatment group on either tilapia or pak choi production. Tilapia productivity was 1.69 ± 0.22 kg/m3 and 1.71 ± 0.23 kg/m3 and pak choi yield was 7.43 ± 1.23kg/m2 and 7.32 ± 0.76 kg/m2 for the RAFT and DRFT, respectively. Water quality parameters were within the recommended range for the tilapia culture while pH and conductivity were out of range for the pak choi culture; nevertheless, plant production was good. Total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen did not reach concentrations that could impede tilapia growth. The DRFT allows the elimination of active aeration in hydroponic systems for tilapia and pak choi production during most of the cycle, reducing the electric power consumption to 10.3\% and electricity costs to 11.4\% by using a nature-based solution.},

The aim was to determine whether a semi-intensive aquaponics system NBF could offer a production alternative for small-scale farmers in this region, both technically and biologically. The Tilapia aquaponics culture was continuously recirculated and water was added (influent) and removed (effluent) from the plant aquaponics culture every 24 h. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrite nitrogen (NO2−-N) were analysed in the plant aquaponics culture influent and effluent. At the end of the experiment the individual fresh total weight, dry total weight, edible weight, height and diameter of the pak choi plants were measured. None of the pak choi variables showed significant differences between treatments. TAN and NO2−-N were higher in the NBF influent than in the BF influent. TAN and NO2−-N in the effluent of both treatments were similar and lower than in the influent. The plant aquaponics culture therefore works as a biofilter and the NBF aquaponics system could be used for small-scale farmers in the tropics, with easier management and less costs than a BF aquaponics system.},

It was evident from the results that mid-range fish stocking densities and accordingly nutrient loads are able to support a plant harvest at a ratio of 1:4 to 1:5 (amount of fish feed provided: harvestable biomass) in both species, depending on the initial size of the plants. Very small plants with sensitive root system should be avoided, as well as increased ammonia loads. Further improvements could be achieved by fine-tunning of the flow characteristics of the system, the standardization of water quality profile, the appropriate selection of substrate and the addition of extra biofiltration compartment.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics integrates two farming methods: aquaculture, which involves the cultivation of aquatic animals, and hydroponics, which involves the production of vegetable crops based on nutritive solutions. In this system both cultured biomasses benefit from the principles of water recycling and nutrients utilization, since the last are excreted by aquatic animals and used by plants grown in hydroponic systems. The plants grown from the aquaculture waste constitute an outstanding advantage of the aquaponics, since reduce the contamination and increase the efficiency of water use, and also limit the environmental impact. Aquaponics can reduce production costs by making more efficient the use of resources, can be established at different production scales, increases economic profitability and diversifies the origin of financial income. The current paper aims to make a general overview on the aquaponics efficiency, by following four main key aspects: technological, waste management, water management and land management aspects.},

  abstract = {This study developed a rapid reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method equipped with a UV-Vis detector. The aquaponics system›s tilapia and marine snoek fishes were extracted using an autoclaving process and enzymatic treatment. The technique enabled the separation and quantification of cobalamin present in these fishes extracts. Phenomenex Luna® 5 µm C18 (2) 100 A LC-column (150 × 4.6 mm) was used as a stationary phase, while the mobile phase consisted of methanol and phosphoric acid in a ratio of 35:65 (v/v), respectively. The developed method was revealed to be rapid (a retention time of less than 5.0 min), linear (R2 = 0.9988), sensitive (limits of detection and quantification showed to be 0.0004 and 0.0011 µg/mL, respectively), precise (percentage relative standard deviation of 0.14\% to 0.76\%), and accurate (percentage mean recovery of 87.44 ± 0.33\% to 97.08 ± 0.74\%). The quantified concentrations of this vitamin in extracts of tilapia and snoek fishes were found to be 08.95 ± 0.35 and 14.97 ± 0.04 µg/ mL, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that the developed RP-HPLC technique could be applicable for quality control evaluation in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Besides, the method could be vital for diagnostic analysis in clinical laboratories.},

  abstract = {This study focused on developing feed for aquaponics that would be beneficial to plant and fish production. Aquaponics is an integrated production system combining aquaculture and hydroponics. However, it is difficult to maintain synchrony between fish and plants because they have different nutritional requirements. Therefore, there is a need to develop feed uniquely for aquaponics systems, to meet the demands of both fish and plants. The results presented are the first phase of a two-phase study. The first phase was a standard feeding trial in a recirculating aquaculture system using the African catfish. Potassium, an essential mineral for fish and plant production, was added to fish feed from different mineral sources to evaluate it as a dietary feed additive. Potassium diformate (KDF) at 3, 6, and 9 gkg−1 and potassium chloride (KCl) at 1.7, 3.4, and 5.1 gkg−1 were used. The trial used three replicates per treatment of 10 fish with an average weight of ± 112 g per 100 l tank for 96 days. Samples were taken after 96 days and one fish per tank was sampled to measure proximate composition, non-specific immunity parameters, tissue mineral analysis, and haematology. To measure production parameters, fish were weighed at the start of the trial and every four weeks subsequently. In separate trials, the effects of the feed additives on water quality and apparent digestibility coefficient of potassium were evaluated. Proximate body composition of the fish was significantly affected by the feed additives, except for the ash content (p {$>$} .0.5). Moisture content significantly differed between the control diet (79\% ± 1.16) and diets containing KCl 1.7 and KCl 5.1(76\% ± 1.44; 76\% ± 0.37). Haematology parameters showed significant differences. Haematocrit (HCT) levels differed significantly from 36.76\% ± 1.84 for KDF 9 to 32.11\% ± 2.30 for KCl 1.7, KDF 9 had the highest Haemoglobin (Hb) levels, while there were no differences in red and white blood cell counts. The water quality parameters tested were also significantly affected by the different dietary treatments. Wastewater from KDF dietary treatments showed improved potassium concentration compared to the control. The study showed that the inclusion of potassium from KDF as a dietary source in fish feed can improve the haematological profile of the African catfish compared to the control, based on this, it has the potential for use in integrated aquaponics systems.},

The aim of current research was to compare the cleaning capacity and plant’s productivity of media bed and raft hydroponic sections as a part of a model aquaponic recirculation system. The impact of different plant growing mediums (cotton wool and rockwool) on lettuce yields was also retraced. For the purpose of this research two types of hydroponic sections (media bed and deep water sections) were constructed and integrated into an existing recirculation aquaculture system. For the trial 36 lettuce seedlings were used. Half of the plants were transferred to cotton wool and the other half of the lettuce plants were transferred to rockwool (Grodan®) substrates and afterwards all plants were placed in hydroponic pots. Eighteen lettuce seedlings (half planted on cotton wool and the other half on rockwool (Grodan®) substrate) were planted on the hydroponic section filled with lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA) and the other eighteen plants (half planted on cotton wool and the other half on rockwool (Grodan®) substrate) were planted on the floating raft hydroponic section.The hydrochemical parameters were measured during the trial. At the end and middle of the trial the fresh weight of lettuce plants was measured.A better removal capacity in ammonium, nitrate and ortho-phospahte were observed in the LECA section compared with the cleaning capacity in the raft section as a part of experimental aquaponic system. The raft technology showed better plant productivity compared with the one found for the LECA bed technology. The productivity of lettuce plants is highly dependent on the type of plant growing medium, when they are cultivated in the floating raft technology.},

The inclusion of L. minuta in diets for carp fingerlings influenced the hydrochemical parameters and decreased the quantity of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in water of tanks where carps were fed with feed containing duckweed, but difference was statistically significant only for ammonium (0.087±0.008)(P≤0.05). The carps fed with a diet containing 30\% (L30) duckweed of their daily feed ratio showed better survival but similar growth and FCR than fish fed with L0 and differences were not significant (P≥0.05). The lower growth and higher FCR were measured in carps fed with L10 compared to the values of these parameters in carp’s fingerlings fed with L0 diet and the differences were significant (P≤0.05). The duckweed presents cheap and easy accessible ingredients for feeding of carp. Furthermore it could be used for treatment of wastewater in recirculating aquaculture systems this way increasing their sustainability.},

We obtained 924 isolates on selective King’s B agar and 101 isolates on MRS agar from different compartments of a model aquaponic system and tested them for antagonism against the plant pathogen Pythium ultimum and fish pathogen Saprolegnia parasitica. Overall, 42 isolates were able to inhibit both fungi. Although not yet tested in vivo, these findings open new options for the implementation of biological control of diseases in aquaponics, where plants and fish are cultivated in the same water recirculating system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is an effective method to practice sustainable agriculture and is gaining popularity in the US; however, the microbial safety of aquaponically grown produce needs to be ascertained. Aquaponics is a unique marriage of fish production and soil-free produce (e.g., leafy greens) production. Fish are raised in fresh water tanks that are connected to water filled beds where fruits and vegetables are grown. The fish bi-products create nutrient-rich water that provides the key elements for the growth of plants and vegetables. The objective of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of the microbial safety and quality of aquaponic lettuce and soil grown lettuce (conventional, bagged, certified organic, and field lettuce). Following this, an intervention study was performed to combat foodborne pathogen surrogates (Salmonella and E. coli), spoilage, and fecal microorganisms using 2.5\% acetic acid. The results of the comparative analysis study showed that aquaponically grown lettuce had significantly lower concentration of spoilage and fecal microorganisms compared to in-soil grown lettuce. The intervention study showed that diluted vinegar (2.5\% acetic acid) significantly reduced Salmonella, E. coli, coliforms, and spoilage microorganisms on fresh lettuce by 2 to 3 log CFU/g. Irrespective of growing methods (in-soil or soilless), it is crucial to incorporate good agricultural practices to reduce microbial contamination on fresh produce. The intervention employed in this study can be proposed to small farmers and consumers to improve quality and safety of leafy greens.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Research and practice during the last 20 years has shown that urban agriculture can contribute to minimising the effects of climate change by, at the same time, improving quality of life in urban areas. In order to do so most effectively, land use and spatial planning are crucial so as to obtain and maintain a supportive green infrastructure and to secure citizens' healthy living conditions. As people today trend more towards living in green and sustainable city centres that can offer fresh and locally produced food, cities become again places for growing food. The scope of urban agriculture thereby is to establish food production sites within the city's sphere; for example, through building-integrated agriculture including concepts such as aquaponics, indoor agriculture, vertical farming, rooftop production, edible walls, as well as through urban farms, edible landscapes, school gardens and community gardens. Embedded in changing urban food systems, the contribution of urban agriculture to creating sustainable and climate-friendly cities is pivotal as it has the capacity to integrate other resource streams such as water, waste and energy. This article describes some of the current aspects of the circular city debate where urban agriculture is pushing forward the development of material and resource cycling in cities.},

  abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is one of the key concepts of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). A DT is a data-driven, digital replica of a real-world object or environment, including all the states and behaviour of the real-life counterpart. Based on research across multiple domains, DTs show great potential to improve both efficiency and sustainability. In addition, a DT is able to remove key constraints of human observations and interactions. Yet, the technology is still in its infancy. Thus, this article presents a literature search across five different databases focusing on suitable approaches for data coupling and the stages of DT implementation integration with Industry 4.0 technologies. The review process follows the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. The selected articles cover a wide range of DT implementations across the agricultural industry, ranging from arable farming to aquaponics. Findings include identification of the stages needed to create the DTs, the data coupling processes, and how Industry 4.0 technologies (e.g., cloud-based technologies, IoT, and AI subfields) are integrated. Findings presented in this article will support others in the design of DTs and integration of Industry 4.0 technologies for agricultural greenhouses.},

  abstract = {This article analyses the legal adaptive capacity for increasing sustainable fish aquaculture production in EUFinland. Currently, fish aquaculture is driven by increasing global demand of fish, declining natural fisheries, food security and blue growth policies. At the same time, environmental policies such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive set tightening legal-ecological requirements for the industry's nutrient emissions. Against this background, the success of blue growth policies related to aquaculture – and the hope of reconciling competing interests at sea – boil down to measures available for dealing with excess nutrients. In line with the mitigation hierarchy, the article establishes four alternative pathways for the fish aquaculture industry to grow without increasing its environmental nutrient footprint significantly, and evaluates the legal adaptive capacity and the legal risks attached to these pathways.},

  abstract = {Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are an alternative technology to tackle the major environmental challenges associated with conventional cage culture systems. In order to systematically assess the environmental performance of RAS farming, it is important to take the whole life cycle into account so as to avoid ad hoc and suboptimal environmental measures. So far, the application of life cycle assessment (LCA) in aquaculture, especially to indoor RAS, is still in progress. This study reports on an LCA of Atlantic salmon harvested at an indoor RAS farm in northern China. Results showed that 1 tonne live-weight salmon production required 7,509 kWh farmlevel electricity and generated 16.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (eq), 106 kg of SO2 eq, 2.4 kg of P eq, and 108 kg of N eq (cradle-to-farm gate). In particular, farm-level electricity use and feed product were identified as primary contributors to eight of nine impact categories assessed (54–95\% in total), except the potential marine eutrophication (MEU) impact (dominated by the grow-out effluents). Among feed ingredients (on a dry-weight basis), chicken meal (5\%) and krill meal (8\%) dominated six and three, respectively, of the nine impact categories. Suggested environmental improvement measures for this indoor RAS farm included optimization of stocking density, feeding management, grow-out effluent treatment, substitution of feed ingredients, and selection of electricity generation sources. In a generic context, this study can contribute to a better understanding of the life cycle environmental impacts of land-based salmon RAS operations, as well as science-based communication among stakeholders on more eco-friendly farmed salmon.},

  abstract = {Global challenges such as climate change, increasing urbanization and a lack of transparency of food chains, have led to the development of innovative urban food production approaches, such as rooftop greenhouses, vertical farms, indoor farms, aquaponics as well as production sites for edible insects or micro-algae. Those approaches are still at an early stage of development and partly unknown among the public. The aim of our study was to identify the perception of sustainability, social acceptability and ethical aspects of these new approaches and products in urban food production. We conducted 19 qualitative expert interviews and applied qualitative content analysis. Our results revealed that major perceived benefits are educational effects, revaluation of city districts, efficient resource use, exploitation of new protein sources or strengthening of local economies. Major perceived conflicts concern negative side-effects, legal constraints or high investment costs. The extracted acceptance factors deal significantly with the “unknown”. A lack of understanding of the new approaches, uncertainty about their benefits, concerns about health risks, a lack of familiarity with the food products, and ethical doubts about animal welfare represent possible barriers. We conclude that adaptation of the unsuitable regulatory framework, which discourages investors, is an important first step to foster dissemination of the urban food production approaches.},

Here, we hypothesized that societal preferences and the acceptability of urban agriculture projects and products are ruling the success or failure of urban agriculture businesses. We surveyed 386 urban participants in Berlin, Germany, to identify general preferences for the productive use of urban space, the acceptance of different urban agriculture forms, and demands and expectations regarding urban agriculture products. The results show first that more than 80 \% of the respondents preferred having accessible systems such as public green spaces, intercultural gardens, and rooftop gardens. Indeed, land uses that do not provide accessibility such as meadows, aquaponic farms, or intensive agricultural and horticultural landscapes showed lower acceptance, of less than 40 \%. Second, 60 \% of participants expressed acceptance of rooftop farming, agriculture in the urban fringe, or in inner-city brownfields, whereas 65 \% rejected to have agriculture in multi-story buildings, agroparks, or aquaponic farms. Third, more than 50 \% are willing to buy horticultural products, but they reject products from intensive production systems and animal-farming mechanisms, with more than 70 \% rejection for animal products. Overall, this is the first study to investigate entrepreneurial urban agriculture possibilities from the perspective of potential consumers. The main insight is that the highest degree of acceptance is reached for multifunctional urban agriculture that combines commercial with ecological and social goals.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics combines aquaculture and hydroponic practices. It is a young new agricultural industry, which depends less on primary energy and material inputs than conventional production systems. Potentially, aquaponic systems have a key role to play in food provision. Furthermore, aquaponics tackles challenges such as land, nutrient and water scarcity and reductions in energy use and food miles. Its controlled growing conditions and the expired use of chemicals and pesticides make this technology a promising one. Besides its ecological merits, aquaponic systems save costs on water treatment and fertilizers and benefit from double outputs (fish and crops). Economic viability, however, requires well-defined business models aimed at positioning aquaponic systems in a specific market niche. Given the different price and quality levels of fresh produce globally, aquaponic systems can be more or less successful as a means for (local) fresh food production. This study looks at one of the most challenging situations for positioning a new growing system: the Dutch food industry with its large-scale horticulture, its multiple fishing harbours and agricultural activities and its highly efficient cooled supply chain. We address the economic viability of aquaponic systems and describe possible socio-economic scenarios. As compared to rural and peri-urban scenarios, it can be concluded that, under the current Dutch market conditions, the urban scenario seems to be the most promising business concept, producing locally, fresh food, relying on premium prices.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Aquaponics is quickly expanding. Specific models and modeling tools have been developed within different studies. However, no study has yet attempted nor succeeded in bringing the aquaponic community around a common modeling project to centralize knowledge and develop an effective tool for users and professional growers. Literature. This paper reviews the relevant literature to provide an overview of the available simulation models and associated modeling tools. Furthermore, it identifies the current needs to lead further modeling developments.  Conclusions. Several powerful models and modeling tools have been developed but are highly specific to their research scope and are often inaccessible. The modeling knowledge specific to aquaponics is at an advanced stage but is scattered among many different works. Therefore, it is evident that a shared and accessible modeling tool, which is currently missing, would greatly accelerate the development of aquaponics.           ,              Synthèse bibliographique des outils de modélisation disponibles pour l’aquaponie et identification des besoins actuels Introduction. Le domaine de l’aquaponie se développe rapidement et de nombreux modèles et outils de modélisation spécifiques ont été développés. Cependant, à ce jour, aucun projet n’a tenté d’unir la communauté aquaponique autour d’un projet de modélisation commun, afin de centraliser les connaissances et développer un outil performant à portée des utilisateurs et des professionnels.  Littérature. Cet article établit la synthèse bibliographique de la littérature pertinente afin de générer une vue d’ensemble des modèles et outils de modélisation disponibles pour l’aquaponie. Cette synthèse tend aussi à identifier les besoins actuels du secteur en outils de modélisation afin d’orienter de futurs développements. Conclusions. Plusieurs modèles et outils de modélisations performants ont été publiés et présentés. Cependant, ces derniers sont spécifiques à leur cadre de recherche et ne sont souvent pas accessibles. La connaissance relative à la modélisation de l’aquaponie a atteint un stade de maturité avancé mais elle reste dispersée au sein de nombreux travaux différents. Un outil de modélisation partagé et accessible fait défaut et pourrait aider à accélérer significativement le développement de l’aquaponie.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics combines the culture of aquatic animals and the cultivation of plants in  recirculating systems, integrating aquaculture and hydroponics in a soil-less system. The present study  aims to evaluate the relationship between water quality parameters and fish and plant growth in an  aquaponics system. Two aquaponics systems, 720L total water capacity and 6900 cm3/min water flow  were designed and constructed. Thirty-four Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus) of 50gr mean body  weight were reared in the two aquaponics systems. Fishes were fed 2.3\% of their body weight daily,  two times per day a pelleted diet with 50\% crude protein. In each system nine (Ocimum basilicum)  basil plants were cultured at 0.7m2 growing area. Fish survival was 100\%. Weight gain (WG) was  statistically significant higher in the first aquaponics system (system I) in comparison to the second  system II, 95.8±13.62g and 51.7±9.90g respectively. Specific growth rate (SGR) was higher in system  I (1.8±0.17\%/day) in comparison to system II 1.2±0.16\%/day but no statistically significant. The food  conversion ratio (FCR) was lower in system I (0.7) in comparison to system II (1.1). Plant survival rate  was 100\%. Total plant biomass (g), height increase (\%) and growth rate were higher in system I  (147.1±28.15g, 45.7±12.42\% and 0.2±0.06, respectively) in comparison to basil cultivated in system II  where it was 131.1±16.7g, 38.8±7.46\% and 0.1±0.03, respectively. Interestingly, basil cultivated in  system II developed more lateral stems 9.3±1.08 than basil cultivated in system I 8.9±1.39,  respectively. Differences between the two systems were no statistically significant. One challenge to  address to the further development of the aquaponics technology is to better understand the conversion  of the toxic ammonium produced by the fish into nitrate, via bacteria in a biofilter, to provide nitrogen  to the plants. Our knowledge on the factors and interrelationships between fish, bacteria and plants in  this biological and technological system is still limited. Additional research will investigate the points  raised for developing aquaponics further as a technology that has the potential to play a significant role  in food production in the future.},

Social systems often suffer from policy resistance, the tendency for well-intentioned interventions to be defeated by the response of the system to the intervention itself. The field of system dynamics, created at MIT in the 1950s by Jay Forrester, is designed to help us learn about the structure and dynamics of the complex systems in which we are embedded, design high-leverage policies for sustained improvement, and catalyze successful implementation and change. Drawing on engineering control theory and the modern theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, system dynamics often involves the development of formal models and management flight simulators to capture complex dynamics, and to create an environment for learning and policy design. Unlike pure engineering problems if any exist human systems present unique challenges, including long time horizons, issues that cross disciplinary boundaries, the need to develop reliable models of human behavior, and the great difficulty of experimental testing. Successful change in social systems also requires the active participation of a wide range of people in the modeling and policy design process, people who often lack technical training. In this paper I discuss requirements for the effective use of system dynamics and illustrate with a successful application to a difficult business issue.},

  abstract = {Studies about integrated farming of shrimp with vegetables are scarce, although productivity may be increased when supplemented with nutrients. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of decreasing concentration of commercial hydroponic solution (treatments 0\%, 20\%, 46\% and 100\%) on water quality (nitrogen compounds, phosphate, conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen), for Amazon river prawn, Macrobrachium amazonicum, and lettuce, Lactuca sativa, seedling development during 18 days. The hydroponic solution significantly increased the total ammonia and nitrate in rearing tanks, up to 60.4 ± 10.3 mg L− 1 and 394 ± 53.7 mg L− 1 (mean ± SEM) respectively at 100\%. These toxic nitrogen levels and other components (trace elements) probably present in the solution decreased Amazon river prawn growth and survival by half when supplemented with 46\% and 100\%, respectively. Independently of the treatment in the first 14 days after sown, no significant change was observed in lettuce growth, however 18 days after sown with a 100\% solution an increased number of leaves, height, fresh mass and plant length were observed. These results indicate that M. amazonicum waste may provide nutritional requirements for lettuce up to 14 days after sown, and afterward a nutrient should be added. We recommend supplementing water with a 20\%-hydroponic solution to not affect development of the Amazon river prawn and to increase lettuce seedling growth.},

  abstract = {Among the diversity of plant diseases occurring in aquaponics, soil-borne pathogens, such as Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp. and Pythium spp., are the most problematic due to their preference for humid/aquatic environment conditions. Phytophthora spp. and Pythium spp. which belong to the Oomycetes pseudo-fungi require special attention because of their mobile form of dispersion, the so-called zoospores that can move freely and actively in liquid water. In coupled aquaponics, curative methods are still limited because of the possible toxicity of pesticides and chemical agents for fish and beneficial bacteria (e.g. nitrifying bacteria of the biofilter). Furthermore, the development of biocontrol agents for aquaponic use is still at its beginning. Consequently, ways to control the initial infection and the progression of a disease are mainly based on preventive actions and water physical treatments. However, suppressive action (suppression) could happen in aquaponic environment considering recent papers and the suppressive activity already highlighted in hydroponics. In addition, aquaponic water contains organic matter that could promote establishment and growth of heterotrophic bacteria in the system or even improve plant growth and viability directly. With regards to organic hydroponics (i.e. use of organic fertilisation and organic plant media), these bacteria could act as antagonist agents or as plant defence elicitors to protect plants from diseases. In the future, research on the disease suppressive ability of the aquaponic biotope must be increased, as well as isolation, characterisation and formulation of microbial plant pathogen antagonists. Finally, a good knowledge in the rapid identification of pathogens, combined with control methods and diseases monitoring, as recommended in integrated plant pest management, is the key to an efficient control of plant diseases in aquaponics.},

  abstract = {The reuse of effluent waters and sediments from African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) recirculation aquaculture systems requires a deeper understanding of the nutrient and energy flows and material pathways. Three semi-commercial systems, differing in stocking density, were sampled for nutritive and pollutant elements of the input- (tap water, feed) and output pathways (fillet, carcass, process water, sediments) by ICP-OES/MS and calorimetry. Highly water-soluble elements, e.g., potassium, accumulated in the water, whereas iron, copper, chromium and uranium where found in the solids. Feed derived phosphorous was accounted for, 58.3–64.2\% inside the fish, 9.7–19.3\% in sediments, and small amounts 9.6–15.5\% in the process waters. A total of 7.1–9.9\% of the feed accumulated as dry matter in the sediments, comprising 5.5–8.7\% total organic carbon and 3.7–5.2\% nitrogen. A total of 44.5–47.1\% of the feed energy was found in the fish and 5.7–7.7\% in the sediments. For reuse of water and nutrients in hydroponics, the macro-nutrients potassium, nitrate, phosphorus and the micro-nutrient iron were deficient when compared with generalized recommendations for plant nutrition. Low energy contents and C/N-ratio restrict the solely use of African catfish solids for biogas production or vermiculture. Using the outputs both for biogas supplement and general fertilizer in aquaponics farming (s.l.) (combined with additional nutrients) appears possible.},

  abstract = {Ortho‐phosphate inside recirculation aquaculture systems is limited as a consequence of precipitation and regular water exchange rates. To improve plant growth in coupled aquaponics, phosphate fertilizer addition to hydroponics can increase PO43−‐P concentrations inside the process water. We investigated the effects of four PO43−‐P concentrations ({$<$}10 (P0), 40, 80, 120 mg L−1) in rearing water on growth performance, feed efficiency, and welfare traits of juvenile African catfish (Clarias gariepinus Burchell, 1822). By trend, optimum specific growth rate of 2.66\% d−1 and feed conversion ratio of 0.71 were observed at 40 and 80 mg L−1 PO43−‐P. Higher PO43−‐P significantly affected skin coloration, swimming activity and external injuries, with the palest and inactive fish combined with most external injuries in the P120 group. Mineral and protein contents in the fish remained unaffected, while fat content inside the fillets enriched with increasing PO43−‐P. Inorganic P in blood plasma increased significantly, while phosphate concentrations inside the fillet remained unchanged. We suggest that PO43−‐P concentrations of 40 to 80 mg L−1 do not reduce the performance of African catfish aquaculture, while increased values of 120 mg L−1 affect fish welfare. This allows limited addition of PO43−‐P fertilizer in coupled aquaponics with African catfish to support plant growth.},

Although the domestic/small-scale aquaponic production has proliferated worldwide, there is scarce knowledge about how it is performed. The objective of this study was to determine the profile and motivations of aquaponic producers, the characteristics of the facilities and the performance of the production. The average aquaponic producer is a middle-aged man, with a certain level of studies and a moderate household income. The main motivations reported were the production of high-quality, healthy food, the concern for the environment and the autonomy gained. These motivations conditioned the purposes of the aquaponic facilities (mainly education, production of food for self-consumption and as a hobby), which, excepting small sales, did not have an economic motive. Due to their characteristics, aquaponic facilities are particularly adapted for urban agriculture (many of them were located on rooftops) and most of those studied were constructed recently. The nutrient film technique was the most used hydroponic subsystem, followed by media beds, where mostly a polyculture of leaf and fruit vegetables and aromatics are produced. Tilapia was the most common fish species used. In general, there is a lack of proper knowledge and expertise about these complex systems in order to efficiently operate them.},

Although these systems have been in development for more than 50 years, the presence of aquaponic products in the markets is still very limited. Previous studies have been carried out trying to characterise consumers, although none was focused on Spain and Latin America. In this work, 636 responses have been obtained to a survey with 27 questions, which has enabled characterising the preferences of potential consumers and their willingness to pay higher prices for aquaponic products. Nearly 60\% of the re­ spondents knew what aquaponic was and this knowledge was influenced by the academic level and the concern for the environment. Most participants considered aquaponics as a very interesting food production system. They were mainly motivated to consume aquaponic products due to their quality and taste and to the absence of pesticides or chemical residues. A remarkable influence of the household income, concern for the environment and, mostly, prior knowledge about aquaponics was found concerning the willingness to pay higher prices. Therefore, advertising campaigns providing specific information on this type of food production would be advisable to increase its degree of acceptance.},

Finding the right combination is a serious challenge and the dependencies avoid a high productivity until now. Therefore, a unique and innovative double recirculating aquaponic system (DRAPS) was developed as a prerequisite for a high productivity comparable to professional stand-alone fish/plant facilities. It consists of two independent recirculating units – a recirculating aquaculture unit for fish production and a closed hydroponic cycle for plant production – which were connected unidirectional. This allows the use of fish waste water as nutrient supply for plants in hydroponics and its optimisation for plant growth by fertilizer supply without negative effects on fish rearing.

  abstract = {The increase of global population causes rising food demand and concomittantly scarcity of resources. These facts including global warming need the further development of resource-efficient food production systems such as double recirculating aquaponic systems (DRAPS). This recent technology is suitable for intensive food production with minimal resource input and maximal reduction of emissions. In DRAPS fish water can be adjusted for plant growth (pH, nutrients) and both species are produced separately under optimum conditions. Primarily, the present study was conducted to investigate the improvement of DRAPS by implementation of an innovative suction filter device and, in addition, it is the first empiric investigation of combined African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L., cv. Pureza) production in DRAPS. Due to an immense loss of nitrogen caused by the primary sedimentation unit as connection between the fish and plant parts, the original DRAPS was modified by a new developed suction filter device to remove solid particles at minimal nitrogen loss. The nitrogen loss was significantly reduced by that system modification (≈43\%) and thus resulted in a quite large reduction of greenhouse gas emissions due to the reduced need for manufacturing of nitrogen fertiliser. The combined production of African catfish and tomatoes in aquaponics revealed similar fruit yields of tomatoes as for the control using artificial fertiliser, while the overall fertiliser use in aquaponics was about 13.2–77.7\% lower. However, fertiliser saving was highest after modification and replacement of the sedimentation unit by the new suction device. In addition, in comparison to already existing aquaponic systems, the total biomass output was significantly increased. The results were evaluated under consideration of intensive crop production in hydroponics.},

This system is based on two separate recirculating systems, a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) and a closed hydroponic system, whereby the composition of fish waste water can be optimized for plant growth by the addition of synthetic fertilizer. However, in the last two years of research it has become apparent that the first approach to DRAPS needs to be reconsidered and further optimized. In the first implementation of DRAPS, the fish waste water passed a sedimentation filter incorporated in the RAS and then a secondary clarifier, constructed as a three-chamber pit, for deposition of solids before delivery to the hydroponic system. It became clear that the depletion of nitrogen caused by the secondary clarifier was too high. Therefore, a new approach was developed and is addressed in the present study: a new suction filter was developed for sludge elimination in the RAS. The first weeks of its use were promising and it is obviously possible to omit the previously used sedimentation filter and leave out the secondary clarifier completely. With this setup, the fish waste water from the RAS was used directly with a minimum of water losses. Another advantage was that the nitrogen concentration in the RAS was kept relatively stable by the use of the new suction filter.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is one way to reduce water pollution produced by fish farming, it can also be an alternative to reduce the amount of water used in the aquaculture system. Water quality is an important factor in fish farming activities because it can affect the growth and development of fish cultivated in reservoir waters. The purpose of this study was to analyze the water quality of the KJA (floating net cages) layered with the aquaponic system tested in the waters of the Koto Panjang Hydroelectric Reservoir. This research was conducted in June - August 2020 at the Koto Panjang Hydroelectric Reservoir. Measurement of water quality parameters is carried out directly at the research location. The analysis of the physical and chemical parameters of the waters is measured in the laboratory and the calculation of the water quality parameters refers to the APHA-AWWA and is compared with Government Regulation Number 82 of 2001 concerning Class II water quality standards. Based on the results of observations on water quality in layered cages with the aquaponics system, it is known that temperature parameters range from 31-33ºC, pH ranges from 5-6, dissolved oxygen ranges from 9.38 - 9.65 mg / L, free carbon dioxide ranges from 9.14 - 11, 12 mg / L and brightness range from 148.9 to 156.2 cm. Meanwhile, nitrate parameters ranged from 0.03-0.04 mg / L and phosphates ranged from 0.30 to 0.06 mg / L. The water quality in the layered marine cage in the aquaponics system in the Koto Panjang Hydroelectric Reservoir has been able to reduce nitrate and phosphate content so that it can reduce the impact of organic pollution that occurs in the waters of the Koto Panjang Hydroelectric Reservoir.},

The crop growth rate results revealed that all four aquaponic growing systems tested in this experiment were able to grow crops and provide yield successfully. However, the substrate-based closed capillary water distribution system (CCWD) had the best overall result, which showed great potential for aquaponic applications to promote alternative agriculture production under unfavored climate conditions.},

The correct implementation of aquaponics helps in providing healthy organic foods with low consumption of water and chemical fertilizers. Numerous research attempts have been directed toward real implementations of this technology feasibly and reliably at large commercial scales and adopting it as a new precision technology. For better management of such technology, there is an urgent need to use the Internet of things (IoT) and smart sensing systems for monitoring and controlling all operations involved in the aquaponic systems. Thence, the objective of this article is to comprehensively highlight research endeavors devoted to the utilization of automated, fully operated aquaponic systems, by discussing all related aquaponic parameters aligned with smart automation scenarios and IoT supported by some examples and research results. Furthermore, an attempt to find potential gaps in the literature and future contributions related to automated aquaponics was highlighted. In the scope of the reviewed research works in this article, it is expected that the aquaponics system supported with smart control units will become more profitable, intelligent, accurate, and effective.},

Accurate and timely monitoring of the plant’s nutrient status grown in aquaponics is a challenge in order to maintain the balance and sustainability of the system. This study aimed to integrate color imaging and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to diagnose the nutrient status of lettuce grown in aquaponics. Our approach consists of multi-stage procedures, including plant object detection and classification of nutrient deficiency. The robustness and diagnostic capability of proposed approaches were evaluated using a total number of 3000 lettuce images that were classified into four nutritional classes—namely, full nutrition (FN), nitrogen deficiency (N), phosphorous deficiency (P), and potassium deficiency (K). The performance of the DCNNs was compared with traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms (i.e., Simple thresholding, K-means, support vector machine; SVM, k-nearest neighbor; KNN, and decision Tree; DT). The results demonstrated that the deep proposed segmentation model obtained an accuracy of 99.1\%. Also, the deep proposed classification model achieved the highest accuracy of 96.5\%. These results indicate that deep learning models, combined with color imaging, provide a promising approach to timely monitor nutrient status of the plants grown in aquaponics, which allows for taking preventive measures and mitigating economic and production losses. These approaches can be integrated into embedded devices to control nutrient cycles in aquaponics.},

Thus, estimating the amount of supplementation needed can be achieved by looking at the nutrient contents of the plant. This study aims to develop trustworthy machine learning models to estimate the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents of aquaponically grown lettuce. A FieldSpec4, Pro FR portable spectroradiometer (ASD Inc., Analytical Spectral Devices Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA) was used to measure leaf reflectance spectra, and 128 lettuce seedlings given four NPK treatments were used for spectra acquisition and total NPK estimation. Principal component analysis (PCA), genetic algorithms (GA), and sequential forward selection (SFS) were applied to select the optimal wavebands. Partial least squares regression (PLSR), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF) approaches were used to develop the predictive models of NPK contents using the selected optimal wavelengths. Good and significantly correlated predictive accuracy was obtained in comparison with the laboratory-measured freshly cut lettuce leaves with R2 ≥ 0.94. The proposed approach provides a pathway toward automatic nutrient estimation of aquaponically grown lettuce. Consequently, aquaponics will become more intelligent, and will be adopted as a precision agriculture technology.},

The aim of this research was to study the use of zeolite, charcoal, and water spinach as components of integrated filters to reduce ammonia concentration in an aquaponic system. This research was conducted for four weeks with three repetitions of water sampling sourced from pond, filters, and output. The results of this study indicated that the use of combination of zeolite, charcoal and water spinach as componentof integrated filters can reduce ammonia throughout the research period.},

  abstract = {A laboratory-scale demonstration of the aquaculture effluent treatment was conducted in a system that combined a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor and a hydroponic cultivation bed (HCB). Cyprinus carpio was used as a model aquaculture fish and Cupsicum frutescens was used as a model hydroponic plant. The aquarium water was circulated through the HCB and DHS using a submerged pump. The experiment was divided into six phases in which the sodium acetate solution was supplied using different feeding patterns. The sodium acetate solution acted as a carbon source and not only eliminated nitrogen through denitrification but also increased the alkalinity through biological degradation of the acetate. Denitrification was observed to eliminate 7.7\% of the total nitrogen at the inlet out of which 53.5\% was converted by C. frutescens to form a fruit. The microbial community in the sludge that was retained in the DHS contained both nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. Nitrososhaera was the dominant ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, whereas Nitrospira was the dominant nitriteoxidizing bacterium. Further, Opitutus acted as the dominant denitrifying bacterium. No major bacterial pathogen was detected in the DHS–HCB system. The study confirmed that the DHS system provided single-stage nitrification–denitrification and that the overall DHS–HCB system provided a low-cost and high-performance aquaculture effluent treatment system that is capable of being used for safe food production.},

Similar systems could be established as small scale systems in most of cases with the potentiality to expand in commercial scale. In Aquaponics could be cultured successfully, most of vegetables and herbs without using any external chemical or other fertilizers or minerals, except the ones that will be produced from the fish wastes. A common and known difficulty is that in most cases in small to medium-sized Aquaponics farms, design and estimations between fish culture biomass and the culture surface are not followed. Additionally, the difficulty of achieving the ideal conditions for both fish and plants leads in many cases to a partial or a total failure of the system. The aim of this article is to participate in the development of a practical, easily applied hydroponics system, using the minimum energy and zero chemical. The data could be used as the basis for any future farmer and could scale up to commercial size.},

  abstract = {Type I collagen is the main component of the extracellular matrix that acts as the physical and biochemical support of tissues. Thanks to its characteristics, collagen is widely employed as a biomaterial for implantable device fabrication and as antiaging food supplementation. Because of the BSE transmission in the 1990s, aquatic animals have become a more suitable extraction source than warm-blooded animals. Moreover, as recently demonstrated, a supplementing diet with fish collagen can increase the body’s collagen biosynthesis. In this context, Tilapia feeding was supplemented with hydrolyzed collagen in order to enhance the yield of extracted collagen. Tilapia skin was investigated with wide and small angle scattering techniques, analyzing the collagen structure from the submolecular to the nanoscale and correlated with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Our studies demonstrated that the supplementation appears to have an effect at the nanoscale in which fibrils appear more randomly oriented than in fish fed with no supplemented feed. Conversely, no effect of a collagen-rich diet was observed at the submolecular scale.},

  abstract = {The world is on a constant momentum of development, creating new opportunities, but at the same time, there are many challenges presented. One of the most serious challenges that people need to face is climate change. Agriculture is the sectors most affected by climate change. Climate-Smart Agriculture will achieve its goals of food security, minimizing climate change effects. For Vietnam, the application of agriculture 4.0 is the application of the achievements of Industry 4.0 (Internet, biotechnology, nanotechnology, lighting technology, robotics ...) to agriculture in order to reduce labor, reduce losses due to natural disasters, pests, environmental safety, save costs in each stage or the whole production - processing - consumption process. Aquaponics system using solar energy is suitable for places with a lot of sunshine, soil is scarce and lack of water resources. This is exactly the case in Vietnam, where water resources are becoming increasingly scarce, only stored in lakes for the main purpose of hydropower. Using an aquaponics system can deal with the water problems that are taking place in many localities, especially in the midlands and mountainous areas. In this system, fish and vegetables will be grown in the same circulatory system. Fish eat food and generate waste, bacteria that will convert fish waste from the aquarium to a form of organic nutrients suitable for plants to grow. Water from the aquaculture system will be transferred into the hydroponic system. Therefore, the waste in the water will be converted by microorganisms into nutrients for plants to absorb again to grow. The water, after being cleaned by the plants in the hydroponic system, returns to the aquaculture system, ending a closed process. In comparison with the conventional aquaculture, the excretions and leftover food from animals can accumulate and increase the toxin in the water; The use of chemical fertilizers in farming affects the environment and people’s health negatively; Considering the benefits of the Aquaponics system: namely fresh fish and clean vegetables, safe water, antibiotic-free fish, safe for health, etc, are outweighed the traditional agriculture. In addition, helping investors save production costs, improve product quality, reduce environmental pollution towards modern green agricultural production.},

  abstract = {Methane gas is a by-product of landfilling municipal solid wastes (MSW). Most of the global MSW is dumped in non-regulated landfills and the generated methane is emitted to the atmosphere. Some of the modern regulated landfills attempt to capture and utilize landfill biogas, a renewable energy source, to generate electricity or heat. As of 2001, there were about one thousand landfills collecting landfill biogas worldwide. The landfills that capture biogas in the US collect about 2.6 million tonnes of methane annually, 70\% of which is used to generate heat and/or electricity. The landfill gas situation in the US was used to estimate the potential for additional collection and utilization of landfill gas in the US and worldwide. Theoretical and experimental studies indicate that complete anaerobic biodegradation of MSW generates about 200 Nm3 of methane per dry tonne of contained biomass. However, the reported rate of generation of methane in industrial anaerobic digestion reactors ranges from 40 to 80 Nm3 per tonne of organic wastes. Several US landfills report capturing as much as 100 Nm3 of methane per ton of MSW landfilled in a given year. These findings led to a conservative estimate of methane generation of about 50 Nm3 of methane per ton of MSW landfilled. Therefore, for the estimated global landfilling of 1.5 billion tones annually, the corresponding rate of methane generation at landfills is 75 billion Nm3. Less than 10\% of this potential is captured and utilized at this time.},

As a result, food imports cost the country nearly \$1 billion annually, causing both economic stress and food scarcity in some areas. The land in the Bahamas does not have characteristics suited to industrialized agriculture, but modern sustainable technologies could be viable agricultural options for Bahamians to pursue. These include hydroponics, aquaponics, and permaculture. Hydroponics and aquaponics use similar soilless technologies to produce food while permaculture is a land‐based agricultural method that focuses on imitating natural ecosystems. While each of these methods have benefits and drawbacks, aquaponics seems to be the most promising method for the Bahamas because it can be used anywhere, regardless of soil quality or availability and provides the opportunity to produce both a protein food source in the form of fish and a vegetable or fruit food source. Producing sustainable food domestically through the use of aquaponics technology can boost the Bahamian economy by reducing agricultural imports and creating job opportunities in the agricultural sector.},

Different fish to plant ratios, T1 (1:0.7), T2 (1:1), T3 (1:1.3) and C1 (aquaponics without plants), C2 (without hydroponic component) were assigned as treatments and control groups respectively. Total yield of O. niloticus (4.69 ± 0.04 Kg m-3), spinach yield (1.42 ± 0.02 Kg/bed) and percentage removal of nitrate (50.43 ± 0.11\%), phosphate (47.62 ± 2.20\%), and potassium (54.26 ± 1.23\%) from the effluent was found to be higher in T3. The daily water requirement of T1, T2, T3 and C1 (1.16–1.29\%) was significantly lower compared to C2 (17.67\%). Findings of the experiment suggest that aquaponics is feasible with low saline underground water and a ratio of 1:1.3 (Nile tilapia: spinach) is the best among tested ratios for balancing nutrient generation and removal as well as fish and plant production. However, further studies using higher fish to plant ratio could be carried out for optimisation of such systems.},

  abstract = {Human population growth has increased demand for food products, which is expected to double in coming decades. Until recently, this demand has been met by expanding agricultural area and intensifying agrochemical-based monoculture of a few species. However, this development pathway has been criticised due to its negative impacts on the environment and other human activities. Therefore, new production practices are needed to meet human food requirements sustainably in the future. Herein, we assert that polyculture practices can ensure the transition of aquaculture towards sustainable development. We review traditional and recent polyculture practices (ponds, recirculated aquaculture systems, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, aquaponics, integrated agriculture–aquaculture) to highlight how they improve aquaculture through the coexistence and interactions of species. This overview highlights the importance of species compatibility (i.e. species that can live in the same farming environment without detrimental interactions) and complementarity (i.e. complementary use of available resources and/or commensalism/mutualism) to achieve efficient and ethical aquaculture. Overall, polyculture combines aspects of productivity, environmental protection, resource sharing, and animal welfare. However, several challenges must be addressed to facilitate polyculture development across the world. We developed a four-step conceptual framework for designing innovative polyculture systems. This framework highlights the importance of (i) using prospective approaches to consider which species to combine, (ii) performing integrated assessment of rearing environments to determine in which farming system a particular combination of species is the most relevant, (iii) developing new tools and strategies to facilitate polyculture system management, and (iv) implementing polyculture innovation for relevant stakeholders involved in aquaculture transitions.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics, the symbiotic integration of aquaculture and hydroponics, has been touted as a sustainable food production technology. While there is anecdotal evidence, there are only a few studies on the economics of commercial aquaponics. In this study, we collect economic and production information from three aquaponic farms to investigate the economic feasibility of an aquaponics industry in Hawaii. Based on the information supplied by the farms, we develop a model case to analyze (i) profitability, (ii) return on investment, and (iii) input requirements for small-scale commercial aquaponics operation in Hawaii. We find that small-scale commercial aquaponics is economically feasible, but our findings are not as optimistic as those previously published. The modified internal rate of return of the model farm is 7.36\%. We conduct sensitivity and decision reversal analysis to investigate how output prices and operational cost parameters affect the overall economic outcome. We find that economic outcome is very sensitive to output price. Investment in commercial aquaponics cannot be supported if annual sales revenue falls by 11\%. We conclude by discussing challenges and risks faced by commercial aquaponic farms and the potential economic gain from organic certification and renewable energy implementation.},

Because of this, more information about this technology at the regional level is needed. In this work, the production of vegetable biomass in an aquaponics system was evaluated using three different sources of water, two of them without previous treatment, through the production of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) and cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Data on height and wet weight were collected and submitted to the Absolute Growth Rate (AGR) and Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and, subsequently, to a 2x3x3 factorial and Tuckey at 5\% probability in order to measure which conditions were more productive. The results for AGR and RGR showed significant differences in the rainy season for tomatoes and okra while turmeric developed better during the dry season. The module with water from the stream showed better results in the rainy season, while the module with water from the public supply in the dry season. No metals were detected at levels harmful to human health or the presence of thermotolerant coliforms at the end of the experiment in both evaluated seasons.},

  abstract = {In recent years, urban contexts and urban-rural linkages have become central for scholars and activists engaged in agrarian questions, agroecological transitions and food system transformation. Grassroots experimentations in urban agroecology and farmers’ engagement with urban policies have marked the rise of a new agenda aiming to bridge urban and agrarian movements. Departing from the work of Eric Holt-Gimenez and Annie Shattuck, this paper argues that the way urban-rural links have been conceptualized is occasionally progressive, and that an agroecology-informed food system transformation needs radical approaches. Acknowledging that processes of urbanization are dynamic, driven by specific lifestyles, consumption patterns, and value orientations – producing ongoing suburbanization, land enclosures, farmers displacement and food-knowledge loss – the paper argues that thinking transitions through new rural-urban links is unfit to tackle the evolving nature of these geographies, and reproduces the distinction between consumers and producers, living on either side of what Mindi Schneider and Philip McMichael have described as an epistemic and ecological rift.},

Building on this work the paper looks at the potential and constraints for overcoming the residual and contingent status of urban agriculture. The first part of the paper aims to expand traditional class/race/ethnicity discussions and to reflect on global, cultural, procedural, capability, distributional and socio-environmental forms of injustice that unfold in the different stages of urban food production. The second part reflects on how to bring forward food justice and build a politics of engagement, capability and empowerment. Three interlinked strategies for action are presented: i) enhancing the reflexivity and cohesion of the urban food movement by articulating a challenge to neoliberal urbanism; ii) converging urban and agrarian food justice struggles by shaping urban agroecology and iii) regaining control over social reproduction by engaging with food commoning.},

  abstract = {The feasibility of using planted biofilters for purification of recirculated aquaculture water in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam was assessed. The plant trenches were able to clean tilapia aquaculture water and to maintain good water quality in the fish tanks without renewal of the water. NH4-N was removed efficiently in the plant trenches, particularly in the trenches with Canna glauca L., probably because of plant uptake and nitrification–denitrification. Plant uptake constituted 6\% of N and 7\% of P in the input feed. Approximately 1.0 m3 of water was needed per kg of fish produced, and 370, 97 and 2842 g fresh aboveground biomass of Ipomoea aquatica Forssk., Lactuca sativa L. and C. glauca, respectively, were produced. The leafy vegetables provide some extra income besides fish products, whereas C. glauca provides nice flowers and contributes to a significant nutrient removal with annual uptake rates of 725 kg N and 234 kg P haÀ1 yearÀ1. This research demonstrates that integrated recirculating aquaculture-hydroponics (aquaponics) systems provide significant water savings and nutrient recycling as compared with traditional fish ponds.},

During this 45 days study we used three distinct kinds of plants like; tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Eggplant (Solanum melongena) and Spinach (Spinacia oleracea). Two experimental medium sized tanks of (2ftx1ftx1.5ft) used as rearing purpose and bottles of capacity near about 1 liter that accommodate riverine small pebbles as grow bed. Experimental feed of 30\% protein was used as a diet for fish having ingredients Rice bran 17\%, Soya bean 36\%, Curry leaves 12.5\%, Chicken liver 27\% and Moringa 2.1\%. This whole experiment was mainly based upon a water quality parameter like pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature, Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate and one- fourth of the tank water is exchanged with fresh water in every 15 days. During starting days of the experiment (1-5 days) all parameters were same in both systems at optimum level but After 5-15 days water quality parameters were start showing fluctuations in NT like; pH 7.6-7.8, Ammonia 0.25-2.50,Nitrite 0-1.0, Nitrate 03.5mg/l and similarly pH 7.6-7.7, Ammonia 0-0.50, Nitrite 0-0.25, Nitrate 0 mg/l in AT system respectively. At the end of the experiment, water quality parameters were showing drastic changes that was pH 7.8-6.8, Ammonia 3-4, Nitrite 2-3, Nitrate 4-5 mg/l in NT system and pH 7.7-7.2, Ammonia 0.25, Nitrite 0, Nitrate 0 mg/l in AT system respectively.

  abstract = {The marine aquaculture sector is growing rapidly. Offshore aquaculture installations have been drawing increasing attention from researchers, industry and policy makers as a promising opportunity for large-scale expansion of the aquaculture industry. Simultaneously, there has also been increased interest in both land-based and nearshore aquaculture systems which combine fed aquaculture species (e.g. finfish), with inorganic extractive aquaculture species (e.g. seaweeds) and organic extractive species (e.g. suspension- and deposit-feeders) cultivated in proximity. Such systems, described as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), should increase significantly the sustainability of aquaculture, based on a number of potential economic, societal and environmental benefits, including the recycling of waste nutrients from higher trophic-level species into production of lower trophic-level crops of commercial value. Several of the challenges facing IMTA in nearshore environments, are also relevant for offshore aquaculture; moreover, the exposed nature of the open ocean adds a number of technical and economic challenges. A variety of technologies have been developed to deal with these constraints in offshore environments, but there remains a number of challenges in designing farm sites that will allow extractive species (e.g. seaweeds and shellfish) to be integrated in fed aquaculture systems and be able to withstand the strong drag forces of open oceans. The development of offshore IMTA requires the identification of environmental and economic risks and benefits of such large-scale systems, compared with similarly-scaled monocultures of high trophic-level finfish in offshore systems. The internalizing of economic, societal and environmental costs of finfish monoculture production by the bioremediative services of extractive species in IMTA offshore systems should also be examined and analyzed. The results of such investigations will help determine the practical value of adopting the IMTA approach as a strategy for the development of offshore aquaculture. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Reducing negative environmental impacts from aquaculture activities is a key issue for ensuring long-term sustainability of the industry. This study examines the major findings and methodology aspects from 28 peer-reviewed studies on marine aquaculture systems integrating fed and extractive organisms. All studies include seaweeds as extractive organisms. The main objective was to analyse the degree of relevance these findings have for large-scale implementation of integrated mariculture practices, and to identify necessary research areas for a future research agenda. The following directions for future research were identified: (1) understand in detail the important biological/biochemical processes in closed recirculating and open seaweed culture systems; (2) conduct research into these advanced aquaculture technologies at scales relevant to commercial implementation or suitable for extrapolation; (3) broaden the focus to include factors affecting seaweed growth and uptake capacity; (4) improve experimental design for statistical calculations; (5) attain a detailed understanding of the temporal variability in seaweed-filtered mariculture systems; (6) define numerical design parameters critical for engineers in designing commercial recirculation systems with seaweed filters; (7) study the influences of location-specific parameters, such as latitude, climate and local seaweed strains/species, on seaweed filter performance; (8) include economic components, considering the added value of seaweeds, and feasibility aspects; (9) analyse the role and function of integrated aquaculture practices for improved environmental, economic, and social acceptability within the broader perspective of integrated coastal management initiatives; and (10) develop educational, training and financial incentive approaches to transfer these novel and somewhat complex technologies of integrated mariculture from the scientists to the industry. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In aquaponics, a closed-loop system which combines fish and crop production, essential nutrients for plant growth are often at sub-optimal concentrations. The aim of the present study was to identify system limitations and thoroughly examine the integrated response of its components to minimal external inputs, notably crop’s functional parameters, fish performance, and microorganism profile. Lettuce and red tilapia were co-cultivated under only Fe and Fe with K supplementation and their performance was evaluated against the control of no nutrient addition. Photosynthesis, the photosynthetic apparatus state, and efficiency, pigments, leaf elemental composition, and antioxidant activity of lettuce were monitored throughout the growth period, along with several parameters related to water quality, fish growth, plant productivity and bacterial community composition. Nutrient deficiency in control plants severely impacted gas exchange, PSII efficiency, and chlorophyll a content, from day 14 of the experiment, causing a significant increase in dissipation energy and signs of photoinhibition. Fe+K input resulted in 50\% and two-fold increase in lettuce production compared with Fe and control groups respectively. Nutrient supplementation resulted in higher specific growth rate of tilapias, but did not affect root microbiota which was distinct from the water bacterial community. Collectively, the results emphasize the importance of monitoring crop’s functional responses for identifying the system’s limitations and designing effective nutrient management to sustain the reduced environmental footprint of aquaponics.},

The majority ({$>$}50 \%) of nutrients sustaining optimal plant growth in aquaponics is derived from waste originating from the feeding of aquatic organisms kept in aquaculture. Currently, aquaponics is more popular as a hobby rather than for commercialscale production. We used long-term data verification to present a qualitative in-depth study of the regional development of aquaponics. We used a questionnaire and in situ interviews to record farm information. In addition, we conducted an Internet search to explore the aquaponics sector and examine the trend in online interest. In contrast to the non-production part of the industry representing 71 \% of the Internet search, com­ mercial aquaponic farms only accounted for 2.7 \%. In total, annual aquaponic production in Czechia peaked at 3 000 kg of fish and 276 kg of plants, produced mainly by one large-scale aquaponic farm that has been in longterm operation. Using Google Trends, we found a positive trend in online interest. However, a developed on­ line “industry” with a positive image creates an unrealistic awareness of aquaponics. On the basis of this exemplary case, a similar trend can be expected in other countries.},

  abstract = {Many aquaculture systems generate high amounts of wastewater containing compounds such as suspended solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Today, aquaculture is imperative because fish demand is increasing. However, the load of waste is directly proportional to the fish production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more intensive fish culture with efficient systems for wastewater treatment. A number of physical, chemical and biological methods used in conventional wastewater treatment have been applied in aquaculture systems. Constructed wetlands technology is becoming more and more important in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) because wetlands have proven to be well-established and a cost-effective method for treating wastewater. This review gives an overview about possibilities to avoid the pollution of water resources; it focuses initially on the use of systems combining aquaculture and plants with a historical review of aquaculture and the treatment of its effluents. It discusses the present state, taking into account the load of pollutants in wastewater such as nitrates and phosphates, and finishes with recommendations to prevent or at least reduce the pollution of water resources in the future.},

Crispa as a leafy plant and strawberry, Fragaria sp. as a fruit plant), pertaining to macro nutrient cycling and effects of plants on water quality parameters. Experiments in an aquaponics system comprising a biological filter and plant unit found that the removal rates of macro nutrients from the system were as follows: 1) 4295\% for phosphate and 55.45\% for nitrate in lettuce and 2) 35.49\% for phosphate and 46.36\% for nitrate in strawberries. It was observed that, in general, the rate of removing macro nutrients was higher in the lettuce experiment than in the strawberries one. The elimination rates of macro nutrients in this study show that increasing dissolved nutrients in an aquarium is effectively reduced, which confirms that this production system is an environmentally-friendly and sustainable method.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic is the combined culture of fish and plants in recirculation systems, has become increasingly popular. Nutrients, which are excreted directly by the fish or generated by the microbial breakdown of organic wastes, are absorbed by plants cultured hydroponically (without soil). Fish feed provides most of the nutrients required for plant growth. As the aquaculture effluent flows through the hydroponic component of the recirculation system, fish waste metabolites are removed by nitrification and direct uptake by the plants, thereby treating the water, which flows back to the fish-rearing component for reuse. Aquaponic has several advantages over other recirculation aquaculture systems and hydroponic systems that use inorganic nutrient solutions. The hydroponic component serves as a biofilter, and therefore a separate biofilter is not needed as in other recirculating systems. Aquaponic systems have the only biofilter that generates income, which is obtained from the sale of hydroponic produce such as vegetables, herbs and flowers. In the UVI system, which employs raft hydroponics, only calcium, potassium and iron are supplemented. The nutrients provided by the fish would normally be discharged and could contribute to pollution. Removal of nutrients by plants prolongs water use and minimizes discharge. Aquaponic systems require less water quality monitoring than individual recirculation systems for fish or hydroponic plant production. Aquaponic increases profit potential due to free nutrients for plants, lower water requirements, elimination of a separate biofilter, less water quality monitoring and shared costs for operation and infrastructure.},

Between 2014 and 2018, the European-funded COST Action FA1305 “The EU Aquaponics Hub-Realising Sustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU” created a strong network of researchers and entrepreneurs. However, surveys show that the aquaponic production in Europe is still very limited, and very few companies are economically viable. In order to obtain insights into the barriers to early development of commercial aquaponics, two surveys were carried out—one in Europe, which included France, and one in France alone, with a different protocol. Henceforth, for simplicity, the former will be referred to as Europe and the latter as France. The results reveal that the development of commercial aquaponics has hit the level of “disillusionment”, caused by numerous challenges facing commercial food production. As the understanding of the processes involved in aquaponics is increasing, it will be very interesting to follow the developments in the field over the coming years in order to ascertain whether aquaponics will follow the phases outlined by the “Gartner’s Hype Cycle” and thus proceed to become an established technology, or whether it will remain an “one hit wonder” and disappear in the “Trough of Disillusionment”.},

The early stages of the aquaponics industry have witnessed a number of unrealistic statements about the economic advantageousness of aquaponics. This chapter deals with these topics and discusses them critically. The latest scientific literature and current personal experiences of European commercial aquaponics farmers are taken into account on three levels: The horticulture side of production, the aquaculture side of production and the early data on the market response to aquaponics, emphasising the marketing issues and public acceptance of aquaponics. In summary, the chapter does not provide an “off-the-peg” solution to evaluate the economic performance of a particular aquaponics system. Instead it provides a broad database that enables an estimation of the efficiency of a planned system more realistically, pointing to challenges that the commercial aquaponics early adopters faced that are important lessons for future aquaponic endeavours, particularly in Europe.},

Several production systems and media exist for producing hydroponic crops (bench bed, nutrient film technique, floating raft, rockwool, perlite, and pine bark). Critical management requirements (water quality maintenance and biofilter nitrification) for aquaculture need to be integrated with the hydroponics to successfully manage intensive aquaponic systems. These systems will be discussed with emphasis on improving sustainability through management and integration of the living components [plants and nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas spp. and Nitrobacter spp.)] and the biofilter system. Sustainable opportunities include biological nitrogen production rates of 80 to 90 g.m(-3) per day nitrate nitrogen from trickling biofilters and plant uptake of aquaculture wastewater.

  abstract = {Integrating hydroponic and aquaculture systems (aquaponics) requires balanced pH for plants, fish, and nitrifying bacteria. Nitrification prevents accumulation of fish waste ammonia by converting it to NO3–-N. The difference in optimum pH for hydroponic cucumber (Cucumis sativa) (5.5 to 6.0) and nitrification (7.5 to 9.0) requires reconciliation to improve systems integration and sustainability. The purpose of this investigation was to: 1) determine the ammonia biofiltration rate of a perlite trickling biofilter/root growth medium in an aquaponic system, 2) predict the relative contribution of nitrifiers and plants to ammonia biofiltration, and 3) establish the reconciling pH for ammonia biofiltration and cucumber yield in recirculating aquaponics. The biofiltration rate of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal was 19, 31, and 80 gÁm–3Ád–1 for aquaponic systems [cucumber, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp. + Nitrobacter sp.)] with operating pH at 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively. With the existing aquaponic design (four plants/20 L perlite biofilter/100 L tank water), the aquaponic biofilter (with plants and nitrifiers) was three times more effective at removing TAN compared with plant uptake alone at pH 6.0. Most probable number of Nitrosomonas sp. bacteria cells sampled from biofilter cores indicated that the aquaculture control (pH 7.0) had a significantly higher (0.01\% level) bacteria cell number compared with treatments containing plants in the biofilter (pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0). However, the highest TAN removal was with aquaponic production at pH 8.0. Thus, operating pH was more important than nitrifying bacteria population in determining the rate of ammonia biofiltration. Early marketable cucumber fruit yield decreased linearly from 1.5 to 0.7 kg/plant as pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0, but total marketable yield was not different. The reconciling pH for this system was pH 8.0, except during production for early-season cucumber market windows in which pH 7.0 would be recommended.},

  abstract = {A simple metabolic model describing growth as the difference between what enters the body and what leaves it, is elaborated assuming that synthetic processes (the building-up, the anabolism) are consuming energy supplied by processes of decomposition (the break-down, the catabolism). This leads to partitioning total catabolism into two components, one being a function of the rate of synthesis, another keeping the body functioning independently of synthesis. The rate of synthesis is described as a function of food taken, of the efficiencies of digestion and energy conversion, and of the absorbing surface of the intestine. Catabolic processes are supposed to be functions of the oxygen concentration in the water, the absorbing surface of the gills, and the rate of oxygen transport. Both kinds of processes are made functions of temperature in the way enzymatic processes usually are. Assuming that molecular interactions accidentally go wrong makes natural mortality, like growth, a function of the rates of anabolic and catabolic processes and body size.Application of the model to data of length-at-age, food and oxygen consumption, weight loss, gill area, and natural mortality indicates that at least some of the main hypotheses cannot be rejected on available evidence.},

  abstract = {Sewage sludge contains rich organic matter and nutrients essential for the growth of plants but the presence of toxic heavy metals restricts its land application. To overcome this, the study aims an eco-friendly approach for leaching out heavy metals. Sewage sludge from sewage treatment plant, Chennai, India was characterised. The analysis of total heavy metal concentration was done by digesting in nitric acid and different forms were extracted by community bureau of reference sequential method. Heavy metals: As, Cd, Cr, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry Perkin Elmer Optima 5300 DV. The experimental set-up for heavy metal leaching was held for five consecutive days at different concentrations of humic acid (0.1\%, 0.5\% and 1\%) at varied pH (5–9). Results revealed that at the end of fifth day at pH 8, 1\% humic acid is capable of leaching out 75.5\% cadmium, 66.0\% nickel, 52.0\% lead, 51.2\% zinc, 31.2\% copper and 8.5\% cadmium from sewage sludge. Statistically positive correlation (0.7088) existed between the percentage of heavy metals leached out and the sum of soluble and reducible fractions. Thus, from ecological point of view, humic acid can be used to leach out heavy metals from sewage sludge serving the need in restoration of soil fertility upon land application.},

In a climate (such as in Bloemfontein, South Africa) including temperatures below freezing, real-time aquaponics monitoring and control is necessary to mitigate thermal losses and to ensure sustainability of fish stock and bio-filter micro-organisms. The system thermal energy also needs sustainable supplementation during wintertime. This study/paper aims to address the problem of monitoring and controlling thermal energy in a medium sized aquaponics system, to ensure biological sustainability, especially during extreme cold weather events.},

  abstract = {Spinach (Spinacia oleracea cv. Carmel) was grown in a conventional glass greenhouse under three different nutrient solution treatments. Lighting and temperature conditions were identical. Six growing systems were used to provide a duplicate trough system for each of these three treatments. Six trials were harvested from each system over a two month time period. Two treatments received hydroponic nutrient inputs, with one treatment at pH 7.0 (referred to as H7) and the other at pH 5.8 (H5), and the third treatment was aquaponic (A7), receiving all of its nutrients from a single fish tank with koi (Cyprinus carpio) except for chelated iron. System pH was regulated by adding K2CO3 to aquaponic systems and KOH to hydroponic systems. Comparisons made between treatments were total yield, leaf surface area, tissue elemental content, and dry weight to fresh weight ratio. Dry weight biomass yield values were not different in pairwise comparisons between treatments (A7 vs. H5: p = 0.59 fresh weight, p = 0.42 dry weight). Similarly, surface area results were not different between treatments. The important comparison was that A7 achieved the same growth as H5, the conventional pH with a complete inorganic nutrient solution, despite unbalanced and less than “ideal” nutrient concentrations in the A7 condition.},

Since California's recent drought was the worst in the last 1200 years, supply of these products may decrease and new sources are needed. To understand the efficacy of growing fruits and vegetables more locally, the energy, water and nutrient impacts of growing fruits and vegetables in local hydroponic and aquaponic controlled environment agriculture systems are compared to vegetables grown in California and shipped to Atlanta, GA. Hydroponically and aquaponically grown fruits and vegetables have areal productivities 29 and 10 times higher than CA-grown vegetables while hydroponically grown vegetables consume 30 times more energy than the CA-grown vegetables. There appears to be no difference in energy consumption between aquaponically- and CA-grown vegetables. On average, 66 and 8 times more water is used in CA-grown vegetables compared to the hydroponic and aquaponic growing techniques. Approximately double the nitrogen needed by plants is applied to CA-grown fruits and vegetables which suggests nitrogen is lost in runoff causing eutrophication downstream. There are 20, 348 and 10 times twenty times more rainfall, nutrients in domestic wastewater and vacant land needed to supply the water, nutrient and space requirements for vegetable production in Atlanta, GA.},

The maximum removal rate of ammonia was 043 g NH4-N m-2 day-t. Nitrite removal by the trickling filter took place when ambient ammonia concentrations were lower than I m g liter-I NH4-N, while at higher ambient ammonia concentrations nitrite accumulated. The fluidized bed columns, employed in the system, were fed with endogenous organic material from the pond. Under these conditions high specific nitrate removal rates were obtained at relatively short retention times. Nitrate removal, however, fluctuated sharply over a diurnal cycle and nitrite accumulation took place under all running conditions examined. Explanations for the nitrite accumulation observed in both filtration systems are presented and possible improvement of the treatment system is discussed.},

This paradigm is used to classify the literature into three categories: focus on operational control, focus on the tactical level, and truly integrated control. Integrated optimal control warrants the best economical result, and provides a systematic way to design control systems for the innovative greenhouses of the future.

In the developed model we adjust the volume of a single fish-tank to the prescribed values of stocking density, by controlling the necessary volume in each time step. Having developed an advantageous feeding, water exchange and oxygen supply strategy, as well as considering a compromise scheduling for the fingerling input and product fish output, we divide the volume vs. time function into equidistant parts and calculate the average volumes for these parts. Comparing these average values with the volumes of available tanks, we can plan the appropriate grades. The elaborated method is a good example for a case, where computational modeling is used to simulate a ‘‘fictitious process model” that cannot be feasibly realized in the practice, but can simplify and accelerate the design and planning of real world processes by reducing the complexity.},

  abstract = {The impact of climate change on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems tends to become more progressively pronounced and devastating over the years. The sector of aquaculture is severely affected by natural abiotic factors, on account of climate change, that lead to various undesirable phenomena, including aquatic species mortalities and decreased productivity owing to oxidative and thermal stress of the reared organisms. Novel innovative technologies, such as aquaponics that are based on the co-cultivation of freshwater fish with plants in a sustainable manner under the context of controlled abiotic factors, represent a promising tool for mitigating the effect of climate change on reared fish. The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) constitutes one of the major freshwater-reared fish species, contributing to the national economies of numerous countries, and more specifically, to regional development, supporting mountainous areas of low productivity. However, it is highly vulnerable to climate change effects, mainly due to the concrete raceways, in which it is reared, that are constructed on the flow-through of rivers and are, therefore, dependent on water’s physical properties. The current review study evaluates the suitability, progress, and challenges of developing innovative and sustainable aquaponic systems to rear rainbow trout in combination with the cultivation of plants. Although not commercially developed to a great extent yet, research has shown that the rainbow trout is a valuable experimental model for aquaponics that may be also commercially exploited in the future. In particular, abiotic factors required in rainbow trout farming along, with the high protein proportion required in the ratios due to the strict carnivorous feeding behavior, result in high nitrate production that can be utilized by plants as a source of nitrogen in an aquaponic system. Intensive farming of rainbow trout in aquaponic systems can be controlled using digital monitoring of the system parameters, mitigating the obstacles originating from extreme temperature fluctuations.},

In this way, it allows the identification of the circular economy system, present in this production circuit. When feeding fish in an aquarium, the excrement produced by them is rich in nutrients that feed the plants that, in turn, filter the water for the fish. With a water pump, that keeps the water in circulation, a continuous closed circuit is achieved. We concluded that, with water and energy savings, without using phytopharmaceuticals, and with naturally occurring processes, an economy of means and the food quality is guaranteed: plants and fish. In studying this, we looked for ways to obtain the material, we do the installation and maintenance of the system, performed daily tasks and monitor the growth of plants and animals, managing to use aromatic herbs for the school bar and also divulge it.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews a century of progress in techniques of bumblebee rearing, starting with those used to encourage bumblebee queens to initiate a colony in artificial domiciles and including those needed for the commercial production of large numbers of colonies for the pollination of agricultural crops. Five species of bumblebees are currently used for crop pollination, the major ones being Bombus terrestris from Eurasia and Bombus impatiens from North America. As a result of their frequent use in foreign territories, there have been reports of B. terrestris becoming established, as well as interactions and/or competition with local (bumble-) bee fauna. Of the many vegetable, fruit and seed crops that bumblebees pollinate, greenhouse tomatoes are of predominant importance. In 2004, 40 000 ha of tomato crops were pollinated, with a crop value of e 12 000 million. The growers benefit from bumblebee pollination because of lower production costs, increased yields, and improved fruit quality. The interrelationship between commercial mechanisms and ecological risks is discussed.},

This article evaluates both the technical setup as well as the economic potential of aquaponic systems and is aimed at identifying relevant knowledge questions for further improvements. Using system requirements for hydroponic systems and aquaculture, the aquaponic system was compared to a typical Dutch rockwool system. Aquaponics was found to be an improvement on current practices when using Deep Flow Technique (cultivation in a flowing thick water layer), resulting in better nutrient availability for the plants and re-use of nitrate. However, the technical challenges of the direct linkage between the two production systems in terms of needed technology and disease management was found to make the total system suboptimal when compared to conventional practices. The technological advantages of efficiency in use of land and energy and re-use of nutrients were found to be a marginal cost reduction of 1.2\%. The article concludes that the added value of aquaponics can be found in the total business concept of producing in an urban environment with direct relationship with consumers. Further improvement of aquaponics can be found in improved disease management of the system – through management or improved design.},

  abstract = {Designing aquaculture production units will require decisions on which treatment to include, e.g., the intensification of the system, and then a decision on a technical solution for each treatment function selected to implement. To complicate matters, each technical solution is not unique to each treatment function, but has a multiple effect on the system. This interaction of a technical solution to multiple treatment functions will play a part in the decision making process. Previous work by the authors has made a taxonomy of all technical solutions for the treatment function, and in this article, how technical solutions affect treatment functions is mapped. The article views the aquaculture production system as a transformation process with three sets of functions, input, treatment and output. Based on a comprehensive literature review where all technical solutions were found and categorized into a taxonomy, their effect on treatment function was mapped using a quality function deployment (QFD). The result is a matrix that gives an evaluation on the interaction. This work is a step towards an aquaculture engineering design methodology.},

  abstract = {En la última década, la acuaponia en México ha tomado importancia económica, pero la información sobre este sistema de producción es limitada. Nuestro sistema de acuaponia fue diseñado para determinar la relación pezplanta adecuada para la producción de tomate. En tanques con 450 L de agua se sembraron alevines de tilapia con peso individual inicial de 0.45 g en tres densidades 120, 80 y 40 peces m-3. Los peces fueron alimentados diariamente a una tasa calculada sobre 7\% del peso corporal por pez. Alimento comercial de 46\% de proteína se usó durante un mes y de 28\% de proteína para los 2 meses restantes. Un total de 48 plántulas de tomate fueron trasplantadas en tres camas de crecimiento (16 plantas por cama) 10 días después de la siembra de peces. La sobrevivencia de peces fue de 100\%, el factor de conversión alimenticia fue de 1.18 y el peso final por pez fue de 62 g. Con la relación 20:1 se obtuvo plantas con longitud promedio de tallo de 160.6 cm, mayor número de frutos (9) y rendimiento promedio de 2.5 kg pta-1. La concentración de nutrimentos en el agua estuvo por debajo de los límites permitidos, sin embargo, la baja concentración de K y la ausencia de Fe y B afectaron el desarrollo de la planta después de 90 días.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is the science of integrating intensive fish aquaculture with plant production in recirculating water systems. Although ion waste production by fish cannot satisfy all plant requirements, less is known about the relationship between total feed provided for f ish and the production of milliequivalents (mEq) of different macronutrients for plants, especially for nutrient flow hydroponics used for strawberry production in Spain. That knowledge is essential to consider the amount of macronutrients available in aquaculture systems so that farmers can estimate how much nutrient needs to be supplemented in the waste water from fish, to produce viable plant growth. In the present experiment, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) were grown in a small-scale recirculating system at two different densities while growth and feed consumption were noted every week for five weeks. At the same time points, water samples were taken to measure pH, EC25, HCO3–, Cl–, NH4+, NO2–, NO3–, H2PO4–, SO42–, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ build up. The total increase in mEq of each ion per kg of feed provided to the fish was highest for NO3-, followed, in decreasing order, by Ca2+, H2PO4–, K+, Mg2+ and SO42–. The total amount of feed required per mEq ranged from 1.6113.1 kg for the four most abundant ions (NO3–, Ca2+, H2PO4– and K+) at a density of 2 kg fish m–3, suggesting that it would be rather easy to maintain small populations of fish to reduce the cost of hydroponic solution supplementation for strawberries.},

We conducted an online survey to get a better idea about research and production in Europe, focusing on five areas of aquaponics (i.e., demographics, facilities used, fish and crops produced, funding sources, and personal or company priorities for further development). The 68 respondents were distributed among 21 European countries, 43\% were working at a university, and 19\% were commercial producers. Only 11.8\% of those surveyed had sold fish or plants in the past 12 months. Most respondents were male (66.2\%) and had a post-graduate degree (91.7\%). Facilities were generally new (74.5\% constructed after 2010) and self-designed. Production figures were modest, with less than 10 respondents producing more than 1000 kg of fish or plants per year (mostly tilapia or catfish and herbs or lettuce). Systems were often funded by government grants (35.3\%). The great majority of respondents (80.4\%) stated that aquaponics was not their main source of income. Most respondents prioritized using aquaponics for educational purposes, while few (25\%) used it to produce their own food or improve their health. Questions related to personal knowledge about aquaponics underlined the need for more training about fish diseases and plant pests.},

Pollinators are extremely important in agricultural crops because their deficit can affect food production in the world. Consequently, a lot of studies have been emphasizing the importance of the knowledge about the biology of these agents. The tomato stands out among the economically most important crops. Therefore, the objectives of this work were: to identify the pollinators of Solanum lycopersicum in a conventional area of cultivation in the southeast of Minas Gerais State and detect which of these are more representative; to assess the importance of the pollinators’ action for the quality of the fruits produced; and discuss practices for conservation to these agents. Fifteen floral visitors were found, with Exomalopsis analis being the most representative. Apis mellifera and Trigona spinipes, although not vibrating bees, also acted as pollinators of Solanum lycopersicum.},

  abstract = {Water pollution is a serious problem in modern society. Agriculture, being responsible for the discharge of agrochemicals, organic matter, or drug residues, produces a huge amount of wastewater. Aquaponics has the potential to reduce both water consumption and the impact of water pollution on fish farming and plant production. In the aquatic environment, inorganic nitrogen is mostly present in the form of nitrate and ammonium ions. Nitrate, as a final product of ammonia mineralization, is the most common chemical contaminant in aquifers around the world. For continuous monitoring of nitrogen compounds in wastewater, we propose a sensor for the simultaneous detection of nitrate and ammonium. A surface plasmon resonance imaging method with enzyme-mediated detection was used. Active layers of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase were created on the gold surface of a biochip and tested for the sensing of nitrate and ammonium in water from an aquaponic system. The proposed sensor was applied in water samples with a concentration of NO3− and NH4+ in a range between 24–780 mg·L−1 and 0.26–120 mg·L−1, respectively, with minimal pretreatment of a sample by its dilution with a buffer prior to contact on a biochip surface.},

Since, the system consists of continuous cycling of the water, the quality of water should be periodically monitored. Manual monitoring of the system can be very tiring. Hence Internet of Things can be used as an effective application for this purpose. The system proposed consists of the continuous monitoring of both the water quality and the plants environment by using different sensors. The information collected by the sensors are accessed remotely by using the Internet of things.

The background of the urban farming concept is the limitations of land in agriculture production by people living in the urban area. Urban farming in Semarang City consists of hydroponic and aquaponic. Hydroponic cultivation is easier to do because of the nutrients needed measurably derived from artificial nutrients (non-chemical). While in aquaponic have two elements, they are aquaculture and vegetables grown. Both of these urban farming concepts have the principle of planting media with no use of land and are appropriately implemented in urban areas. The purpose of this research is to know how urban farming management system in Semarang City. The research method used is quantitative descriptive and conducted in Semarang City. The primary data were collected by questionnaires and field observations, while the secondary data came from the literature study and previous research.

It is a method of growing vegetables without the using soil as a rooting medium, in which the inorganic nutrients absorbed by the roots are supplied through irrigation water. It includes hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics. Hydroponics is the growing of vegetables in an fed with a solution containing a mixture of macro and micro-nutrients. Aquaponics is the technique in which, aquatic animals such as snails, fish, crayfish, prawns, etc., are grown in tanks with combination of hydroponics with vegetables are grown in water in a symbiotic environment. In aeroponics system, sealed root chamber is used as reservoir for nutrient solution where the plants above the reservoir cover with polystyrene/other material. It must be supported or hanged through holes in the expanded cover and are misted with nutrient solution to keep it always moist. Soil- less cultivation has been followed in number of vegetables such as, tomato, chilli, brinjal, green bean, bell pepper, cauliflower, cucumber, melons, radish, onion, lettuce, beet, winged beans, water spinach, spinach, coriander, and so on. Soil-less cultivation helps in early nursery raising and easy management, production of healthy vegetable seedlings free from disease, insects and pest. It has various benefits like; year-round production and off season, higher productivity and uniform quality, management of insect-pests, diseases and weeds is easier which helps in more efficient and less use of resources. Soil less cultivation has huge potential to become popular in upcoming future generation. This advance technologies and techniques involved in soilless vegetable cultivation can be said as nextgeneration crop science hence, it can open a doorway to establish a new civilization in outer space.},

  abstract = {Nutrient film technique (NFT) is a popular, ergonomic, hydroponic system, but is not often used in commercial aquaponic systems due to lower efficiency in overall nutrient removal. Experiments were conducted to assess if NFT lettuce production could be improved by exchanging aquaculture effluent more frequently, and if so, determine the optimal water exchange rate. The AE was taken from a biofloc-based nile tiapia production system. Treatments consisted of increasing hydraulic retention time (HRT (d)) viz: four-, eight-, twelve-, or sixteen-day water exchanges arranged in a randomized complete block design with five blocks. In one trial (trial 1) where iron (Fe) was not supplemented, there was one replication. There were three replications for the second trial with iron supplementation. The analysis of lettuce plant size index and chlorophyll index (SPAD units) in trial 1 was statistically different among the HRTs beginning 14 days after planting, exhibiting negative linear trends with increasing HRT. However, most foliar micronutrients were borderline sufficient, and all treatments showed foliar Fe deficiency. After iron supplementation (trial 2), lettuce plant chlorophyll and size index exhibited quadratic trends with increasing HRT on 14 and 21 DAP, respectively. In trial 2, plant fresh mass decreased linearly from 162.1 g/head to 147.1 g/head, with increasing HRT. Furthermore, iron supplementation eliminated Fe deficiencies in the plants albeit only up to 14 DAP. Our findings suggest that shorter hydraulic retention times provide a solution to using the NFT system in aquaponics especially with iron supplementation.},

Dobrocz., Plantago coronopus L., and Salicornia dolichostachya (Moss.). Halophytes, illuminated by sunlight and supplemented with artificial light, were maintained in hydroponic cultures integrated in a RAS water treatment system operating at 16 psu salinity. During a 35-day experiment, 248 fishes gained 5.6 kg of weight. Total plant biomass production reached 23 kg in 14 m2 hydroponic culture area. Gain of shoot biomass was 27, 18, and 60 g m-2 day-1 for T. pannonicum, P. coronopus, and S. dolichostachya, respectively. The plants retained 7 g phosphorus and 46 g nitrogen under the experimental conditions. This was equivalent to 9 \% of the N and 10 \% of the P introduced with the fish feed. The edible part of the harvested plant material was microbially safe and approved for human consumption. The coupling of production in a RAS–IMTA was tested as a feasible cascading production technology for sustainable aquaculture.},

  abstract = {Basil (Ocimum sp.) is the most popular fresh culinary herb. However, there is a lack of data characterizing the effect of hydroponic production systems and cultivars on the yield of hydroponically produced basil. Our objectives were to quantify productivity and characterize growth of basil cultivars grown in two hydroponic production systems. Thirty-five basil cultivars, including selections of sweet basil (O. basilicum), holy basil (O. tenuiflorum), and lemon basil (O. ·citriodorum and O. basilicum) were chosen. Seedlings were transplanted into nutrient film technique (NFT) or deep flow technique (DFT) systems and grown for 3 weeks. There was no interaction between basil cultivars and hydroponic production system. Fresh weight of plants grown in DFT systems was 2.6 g greater compared with plants grown in NFT systems. Basil cultivars differed greatly in fresh weight. In general, holy, lemon, and sweet basil cultivars produce moderate to high fresh weight, but vary greatly. Dissimilarly, bush (O. basilicum var. minimum), cinnamon (O. basilicum), large-leaf (O. basilicum), and thai basils (O. basilicum var. thyrisiflorum) produce moderate fresh weight and purple basil (O. basilicum) cultivars produce the least fresh weight. The yield of basil seems to be affected more by cultivar selection than hydroponic production system. Therefore, hydroponic basil producers should select basil cultivars based on flavor and yield, while hydroponic systems should be selected based on operational preferences.},

The primary objective is to design a smart monitoring and control device for aquaponics, which is an eco-friendly system for ornamental fish and hydroponic plants. The significance and specific functions of the system was firstly described in details, and then the architecture, hardware components and software design were also introduced. The system consists of three parts: data acquisition, mobile transfer and intelligently interactive application. Specifically, the data that acquired by webcam and some smart sensors are analyzed and processed for man-machine interaction. Meanwhile, users can also use the mobile terminal to monitor and control the smart aquaponics remotely. The design of the system can promote the rapid development of smart aquaponics.},

  abstract = {Our previous study reported that fresh produce grown in aquaponic and hydroponic systems can pose potential food safety hazards due to an accidental introduction of contaminated fish and cross-contamination between the systems. In this study, we examined the effects of plant species and age on the likelihood and level of internalization of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in aquaponic and hydroponic systems. Four plant species, basil (Ocimum basilicum L. cv. Genovese), cilantro (Coriandrum Sativum L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Cherokee), and kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica), received root damage treatment as seedlings before transplanting or mature plants at three weeks after transplanting by cutting off 1-cm tips of one-third of the roots. Enrichments and selective media were used for the isolation, and presumptive positive colonies were confirmed by PCR for the presence of stx1 gene in plant tissues, recirculating water, and fish feces collected at four weeks after transplanting. In hydroponic systems, STEC was found neither in the solution nor in the roots and leaves of all four plant species, possibly through improved sanitation and hygiene practices. However, consistent with our previous findings, STEC was found in the water, on the plant roots, and in the fish feces in aquaponic systems, even after thorough sanitation prior to the study. Regardless of plant age, STEC was internalized in the roots of all plant species when the roots were damaged, but there was no difference in the degree of internalization with STEC among plant species. STEC was present in the leaves only when seedlings received root damage treatment and were grown to maturity, indicating that root damage allows STEC to internalize in the roots within a week, but a longer period is required for STEC to internalize into the leaves. We concluded that root damage on seedlings can cause the internalization of E. coli O157:H7 in the edible parts of leafy vegetables and herbs in soilless production systems.},

  abstract = {The discharge of water effluents from aquaculture systems pollutes the waters of the ambient environment and is a major concern in the development of sustainable aquaculture. In this study, we examined the effects of fish stocking density on water quality and biomass yields in a recirculating aquaponic–membrane filtration system used for co-culturing tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica). The system was composed of a fish tank, sludge tank with a filtration membrane, and hydroponic tank. Tilapia (average initial weight, 1.8 g) was examined at three densities: 450 (low), 600 (medium), and 750 (high) individuals per tank. The initial density of water spinach was 8.3 g m–2. The experimental period with no water exchange lasted for 12 weeks. Our results revealed that the increasing density of tilapia correlated positively with the increasing weight gain of water spinach but negatively with the growth of tilapia. The average weight gains were 10.8, 8.3, and 4.0 g in the low-, medium-, and high-density groups, respectively. The levels of NH4+–N, NO2––N, NO3––N, orthophosphate, biochemical oxygen demand, total bacterial counts, and turbidity in the fish and plant tank effluents were significantly higher in the high-density group than in the low-density group. The total weight gains of plants were 1,204, 1,402, and 1,708 g in the low-, medium-, and high-density groups, respectively. These results indicated that membrane filtration combined with a hydroponic component maintained a suitable water quality in the system for the survival of fish. However, the highest fish biomass gained was observed in the medium-density group, and the highest plant yield was obtained in the high-density group.},

In this study, the technology of Internet of Things (IoT) was introduced into science and technology agriculture, and the IoT-based Aquaponics System (IAS) was actually built. In the study, the feasibility of precision technology agriculture was confirmed, and the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional greenhouse planting system and IAS were compared. In addition, in order to solve the problem of farmers lacking the ability to use information interfaces, the Intelligent Voice Control System (IVCS) of the Internet of Things was proposed in this study. The traditional unfriendly operation interface can be successfully replaced by IVCS. Therefore, IVCS can provide partners who are interested in the development of science and technology agriculture with a lower barrier to entry for science and technology, and inspire more diverse applications to effectively improve the production efficiency of agriculture, fishery and planting.},

Furthermore, additional data has also been collected from public places such as campuses to support current data collection. The data is collected in order to recognize the visitors’ responses according to their tourism information needs in preparing their traveling activities. Descriptive research method adopted using self-designed questionnaires focusing on “what” is applied to investigate the questions which are related with the topic of the study. The results of data analysis would be referred as foundation in designing the system functionalities required to develop an application for the future development. Furthermore, more data is observed from some data resources such as Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) of DKI Province and Global Destination Cities Index to recognize the performance of DKI Jakarta in receiving visitors within the last three years compared to other cities in some neighboring countries such as Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Thirty respondents are involved in the study to identify what potential information which can be explored. The information which is related to visitors’ travel preparation becomes imperative to be analyzed to optimize the tourism promotion. Descriptive research method helps researchers in obtaining data on functional needs according to the current state of society, in the scope of travel activities and preparations. The system design viewed from the functional needs shows what people can do based on the results of the analysis.},

  abstract = {Optimal crop production in aquaponics is influenced by water pH and potassium concentrations. The addition of potassium hydroxide (KOH) into the recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) may benefit aquaponics by increasing the water pH for better biofilter activity and supplementing K for better plant growth and quality. We investigated the growth, feed conversion, body composition and welfare indicators of juvenile African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) treated with four concentrations of K (K0 = 2, K200 = 218, K400 = 418, and K600 = 671 mg L−1). While growth, feed conversion and final body composition were unaffected, the feeding time and individual resting significantly increased with increasing K+. The swimming activity and agonistic behavior were reduced significantly under increased concentrations of K+. Leftover feed and the highest number of skin lesions were observed under K600. We suggest that K+ concentrations between 200 and 400 mg L−1 can improve the welfare status of juvenile African catfish. This enables the application of KOH in RAS to supply alkalinity to achieve optimum nitrification at minimum water exchange and improve the nutritional profile of the process water with benefits for the welfare status of African catfish and aquaponics plant production and quality.},

This experiment compared unaltered aquaponic nutrient solution at pH 7.0 (treatment A7) with sterilized aquaponic nutrient solution at pH 7.0 (treatment SA7) to quantify effects that live microorganisms had on the growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Baseline comparisons were made to conventional hydroponic conditions using inorganic nutrients at pH 5.8 (treatment H5) or pH 7.0 (treatment H7), which showed a 51\% reduction in lettuce fresh weight (FW) growth, indicating a strong negative effect of the higher pH nutrient solution; a similar large difference (38\%) occurred for dry weight (DW) comparisons between these two treatments. No difference occurred between the sterilized aquaponic treatment (SA7) and H5 in FW or DW. H5 produced more FW and DW than the non-sterile aquaponic treatment (A7). Responses were not different in FW and DW between the two aquaponic conditions. Reduced FW and DW of A7 compared to H5 may be related to the 50 times higher microbial community living in the A7 treatment water than in H5 at the beginning of each trial. Given that the sterile aquaponic solution SA7 and the H5 hydroponic condition were not different in performance, we concluded that the beneficial effects of the microbial community in the fish recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) occurred before the water was sterilized. An interesting implication of our findings is that an RAS can be decoupled from the hydroponic growing system, since its benefits are not dependent upon continuous recirculation between the plant and fish system and its living biotic community.},

In order to fully exploit the advantages of RAS, however, the water exchange should be as small as possible. This implies strong demands on the water treatment, e.g. the maintenance of an efficient nitrification, denitrification and organic removal. Because of the RAS complexity, though, dynamic simulations are required to analyze and optimize a plant with respect to effluent water quality, production and robustness. Here, we present a framework for integrated dynamic aquaculture and wastewater treatment modelling. It provides means to analyze, predict and explain RAS performance. Using this framework we demonstrate how a new and improved RAS configurations is identified.},

Water consumption as well as the environmental impact are lower in this system compared to hydroponic system and traditional aquaculture system. The recent study evaluated the microbiological quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) farmed in two production systems: aquaponics and hydroponics. At the same time, we evaluated fresh mass gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The lettuce was farmed in an aquaponic system with waste from the fish, and in a hydroponic system with nutrient solution (Hoagland II-modified) for 21 days. At the end of this term, large lettuce was gotten from 8 to 12 cm. The lettuces that grew in both systems did not showesignificant differences in the microbiological quality. The aquaponic system started with rainbow trout, which have an average mass of 27.1 ± 0.8 g, and duringthe experiment rainbow trout gained 13.6 g, getting a FCR of 0.74 after the experiment. These results indicate that the aquaponic system used is a sustainable alternative for the production of high quality lettuce, allowing at the same time the farming simultaneous of fish with a good feed conversion ratio.},

This study has been developed to determine if aquaponics production could be a viable alternative or accent to the current means of production of plants and fish species in Iceland, based on import trends, local production, energy allotments, cultural nuances and consumer habits. The thesis analyzes a literature review for previously-held theories on purchasing habits for consumers, provides a review of agriculture and aquaculture production and adopts a consumer analysis survey over motivators for organic/sustainable fish and produce. Ultimately, the thesis suggests that aquaponics is a viable option in theory, given the conditions of the environment and access to resources; however, for it to be a successful venture will take a higher level of awareness and precise promotion in domestic ventures that reaches out to both locals and tourists. The consumer models suggest a niche attitude for Icelandic consumers that can be capitalized on to help provide a more positive attitude that manages price barriers as incentives and gives a more transparent environmental appeal.},

  abstract = {An aquaponic system is considered to be a sustainable food production solution that follows circular economy principles and the biomimetic natural system to reduce input and waste. It is the combination of two mainly productive systems, a recirculating aquaculture system consists of fish and crustaceans farmed in a tank and hydroponic cultivation consists of vegetable cultured in medium other than soil. Both these systems are well-known around the globe by their performance of production, quality, and verified food safety. An aquaponic system is an industrious mechanism which incorporates impeccably with sustainable growth of intensive agriculture. The existing literature regarding the aquaponic production covers different species of vegetables and fish, a variety of layouts of system, and climate conditions. However, there is a lack of knowledge that can systematically present the existing state-of-the-artwork in a systematic manner. So to overcome this limitation, the proposed research presents a systematic literature review in the field of urban aquaponics. This systematic literature review will help practitioners to take help from the existing literature and propose new solutions based on the available evidence in urban aquaponics.},

MES is there to link between the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and the plant equipment control or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) applications. In this paper the MES of the INAPRO aquaponics system which was developed to support and advise the aquaponics managers in operating the complex aquaponic farms, will be presented. One important feature of the INAPRO aquaponics system is to minimize fresh water {$<$} 3\%, energy and nutrient supplies. This can only be achieved by appropriate design of the fish and crop mixture, considering the fish to crop ratio, when to sow the crops etc. and to monitor the system to see whether it performing as designed or not. Therefore, the MES has a view to show the designed system with all the material flow (water, energy and nutrients) balances and also how the system will be performing for a given predictive horizon. Knowing the future developments of the system, the operator can taking corrective measures to make sure that the system is behaving as required. An example of water balance of a system with 40 m3 fish tanks coupled with a hydroponic NFT system with 1,000 m2 which can produce five tons of Tilapia and 75 tons of tomato yearly is given.},

They aimed at domestic self-sufficiency and self-sufficiency by proxy (via farmland investments abroad). These strategies have failed. Water scarcity at home increasingly compromises agricultural production. Farmland investments abroad have not matched ambitious related announcements due to a complex mixture of commercial, socio-economic and political factors. They do not contribute meaningful quantities to the Gulf countries’ food imports. The failure of such strategies has prompted a shift of focus instead towards value chain management as a means to secure food availability. Rather than trying to fight food import dependence, the Gulf countries now accept and manage it. However, malnutrition that leads to high levels of obesity and diabetes constitutes a risk factor in the face of COVID-19. Food accessibility for vulnerable population segments such as migrant labour is another issue that requires yet further policy measures, such as safety nets – whose expansion would be politically controversial if not impossible, however.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a technology for food production (fish and vegetables/fruits) with concomitant remediation of nitrogen-rich aquaculture effluent. There is, however, a critical need to improve the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in aquaponics. Here, we employed quantitative polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing to evaluate the bacterial communities and their links to nitrogen transformations for improving NUEs in four bench-scale plant-based floating-raft aquaponics (pak choi, lettuce, chive, and tomato) and three pH levels (7.0, 6.0, and 5.2). Low relative abundance of nitrifiers in plant roots and biofilters suggested nitrogen loss, which decreased NUE in aquaponics. Low pH level was a major factor that shifted the microbial communities and reduced the relative abundance of nitrifiers in aquaponic systems, leading to total ammonia nitrogen accumulation in recirculating water. In plant roots, the abundance of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g., Nitrospira spp.) did not decrease at low pH levels, suggesting the benefit of growing plants in aquaponics for efficient nitrification and improving NUE. These findings on microbial communities and nitrogen transformations provided complementary strategies to improve the performance of the aquaponics regarding water quality and extent of nutrient recovery from aquaculture effluent.},

However, there are several challenges of bioponics, especially nutrient availability and qualities, which affect plant yield. In this study, chicken manure based-nutrient film technique bioponics was examined at manure loadings of 200, 300, and 400 g dry wt. per bioponic system (total of 18 plants). Bioponics effectively released nitrogen and phosphorus (total ammonia nitrogen of 5.8–8.0 mgN/L, nitrate of 7.0–11.2 mgN/ L, and phosphate of 48.7–74.2 mgP/L) for efficient growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa; total yield of 1208–2030 g wet wt. per 18 plants). Nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiencies were 35.1–41.8\% and 6.8–8.0\%, respectively, and were comparable to aquaponics. Next-generation sequencing was used to examine the microbial communities in digested chicken manure and plant roots in bioponics. Results showed that several microbial genera were associated with organic degradation (e.g., Nocardiopsis spp., Cellvibrio spp.), nitrification (Nitrospira spp.), phosphorus solubilization, and plant growth promotion (e.g., WD2101\_soil\_group, and Bacillus spp.). Nocardiopsis spp., Romboutsia spp. and Saccharomonospora spp. were found at high abundances and a high degree of co-occurrences among the microbiota, suggesting that the microbial organic decomposition to nitrogen and phosphorus release could be the key factors to achieve better nutrient recovery in bioponics.},

However, the fate of nitrogen in aquaponic systems has not been fully understood, leading to difficulty in optimizing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and plant production. In this study, the fate of nitrogen in floating-raft aquaponic systems with two plant species, pak choi (Brassica rapa L. chinensis) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa longifolia cv. Jericho), and tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) was evaluated using mass balance and natural abundance nitrogen isotopic compositions. Dissolved oxygen (DO) levels associated with hydraulic loading rate (HLR) were found to positively affect nitrite oxidation rate. Increase in nitrite concentration was observed in recirculating water under low DO levels. Nitrite is an intermediate in the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to N2 gas. Based on progressive enrichment of 15N of nitrate with time in the recirculating water, we estimated total nitrogen loss of up to 46.3\% via denitrification. Nitrogen loss via denitrification was reduced by 44e56\% when the feed-to-plant ratio was decreased by 30\%. Results of this study provide better understanding of nitrogen transformations, which could help in designing and operating efficient aquaponic systems.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen, a critically important nutrient that boosts yields in agriculture and food production, is currently overused to meet the rising demand for food. Surplus nitrogen ends up in the environment in excess of the capacity of natural nitrogen cycle, thereby leading to serious environmental pollutions, such as eutrophication of water bodies and emission of nitrous oxide (a highly potent greenhouse gas) to atmosphere. Aquaponics− bioponics is an emerging soilless technology for nitrogen recovery that links organic vegetable production to aquaculture effluent remediation (aquaponics) or organic waste recycling (bioponics). This Review presents the concept of aquaponics−bioponics for nitrogen recovery. Nitrogen transformations and nitrogen mass distributions in aquaponic−bioponic systems are critically discussed, along with the nutrient availability of several organic composts that can be integrated with the systems, and the microbial communities involved. This discussion is followed by a dynamic nitrogen modeling for managing nitrogen from different wastes in aquaponics−bioponics. Various emerging engineering technologies that could improve aquaponics−bioponics are presented, including aeration with microbubbles and/or nanobubbles, cocultivation with algae, process automation with Internet of Things, and integration with indoor vertical farming (plant factory with artificial light). Overall, the Review lays out the state-of-art in aquaponics−bioponics and highlights potential approaches for developing highly efficient nitrogen recovery technologies from diverse organic waste streams.},

Fundamental understanding of nitrogen transformations in aquaponics is critically important to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) within aquaponics systems and to reduce release of environmentally harmful effluent and gases. This study elucidated nitrogen transformations in floating-raft aquaponic systems using four plant species, namely lettuce (Lactuca sativa longifolia cv. Jericho), pak choi (Brassica rapa L. Chinensis), tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum), and chive (Allium schoenoprasum L.). Using nitrogen mass balance and 15N labeled nitrogen species, it was found that nitrate was the primary form of nitrogen assimilated by plants. Nitrification and denitrification occurred simultaneously in the aquaponic system, resulting in an inevitable nitrogen loss (22.3–29.3\% of nitrogen input). Nitrogen loss via nitrifier denitrification (33.7–55.3\%), which was stimulated by low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (∼3.8 mg/L), and denitrification occurred simultaneously. Moreover, nitrogen loss from the aquaponic system in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, accounted up to 0.72–1.03\% of the nitrogen input. Aerating biofilters to prevent the formation of anoxic zones reduced total nitrogen loss but did not affect N2O emission. This study suggests that increasing DO concentrations only by aeration does not improve NUE and reduce N2O emission simultaneously.},

  abstract = {Urban planners, government leaders, and the farming community have noted the important role cities play in producing their own food to manage higher levels of domestic demand, food insecurity, environmental concerns and affordability. To better understand these issues our research examines urban farming; in particular, the use of vertical farming methods. Such approaches can be used to overcome not only food safety and land resource issues, but also better manage the threats posed by rapid urbanisation. With technological developments in hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics, vertical farming has become a much more efficient and affordable means of farming in urban spaces. Overall, these high-tech systems signify a shift in the ways farming and food production can be operationalised. The results from our analysis show that Singapore, a tropical city in Asia, is making significant strides in vertical farming with substantial public and private investment in R\&D through high-tech, high-yielding, land-limited farms in high-rise buildings. Despite these initiatives, Singapore faces a highly constrained urban environment where land scarcity is exacerbated by a complex regulatory land use framework.},

  abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate and compare the growth performance of four juvenile Oreochromis niloticus strains in pond culture. The fish having an average body length of 9.18 cm and weight of 12.48 g were collected from Hawassa, Ziway, Koka, and Hora lakes. They were stocked in triplicate in 5.0 m × 5.0 m × 1.5 m concrete earthen ponds in 1 m water depth. The stocking density was 2 fish/m3. The fish were fed 3\% of their body weight per day manually, twice a day with locally available feed having 23\% crude protein. The results showed that the Koka strain had the best strain and had significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) higher final mean body weight (FMBW), mean body weight gain (MBWG), specific growth rate (SGR) and gross fish yield (GFY) than the Ziway and the Hora strains, but not from the Hawassa strain. The Koka stain had the best feed conversion ratio (FCR) with slightly higher Fulton’s condition factors (FCF). However, statistical analysis showed that there was no significant difference in FCF and FCR among the four strains. Except for the Ziway strain, all the strains revealed an isomeric growth pattern. The overall conclusion is that growth performance between the four strains of Oreochromis niloticus was significantly different and thus, it is crucial to select the right strain for aquaculture purpose. However, further research may still be needed to compare more strains from different Ethiopian lakes to evaluate the genetic potential for Oreochromis niloticus breeding program.},

  abstract = {Small-scale hydroponic and aquaponic crop production is increasingly common in urban areas of the US and growers have questions about which system and crops to use. Hydroponic nutrient solution contains water soluble nutrients, electrical conductivity (EC) is maintained between 1 and 3dSm\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater-1\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater, and target pH is between 5.5 and 6. In contrast, plants in aquaponic systems are fertilized by aquaculture effluent, which is characterized by lower EC (less than 1dSm\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater-1\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater) and a target pH near 7.2. Duplicate greenhouse trials were conducted between 2013 and 2015 to assess the growth, yield, quality, and potential gross returns of four crops - basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), kale (Brassica oleracea L.), chipotle pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), and cherry tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) - grown in a recirculating ebb-and-flow system with nutrient solution EC and pH levels commonly observed in hydroponic (high EC-low pH) and small-scale aquaponic (low EC-high pH) systems. Solution pH and EC, plant height, and leaf greenness data were collected regularly throughout crop growth, and yield and percent soluble solids (°Brix) data were collected at harvest. Crops grown in the high EC-low pH solution approached a greater final height, but relative growth rate was not different from the low EC-high pH solution. Leaf chlorophyll content, estimated from leaf greenness, was up to 37\% lower in the low EC-high pH solution. Marketable yield of basil and kale was reduced by 44\% and 76\% in the low EC-high pH solution, respectively. Yield loss in tomato and pepper was less severe (\textbackslash textless32\%), but still significant. Observed yield reductions were greater than previous comparisons of floating-raft aquaponic and hydroponic systems, which demonstrates the importance of root to nutrient solution contact area and fertigation frequency when using low EC-high pH nutrient solution (e.g., aquaculture effluent). Differences may also suggest there are components of aquaponic solution not tested in this mechanistic study (e.g., organic metabolites and alternative nutrient forms or ratios) that may contribute to crop growth and yield in aquaponics. On a per plant basis, kale (10.62) and cherry tomato (9.16) grown in the high EC-low pH solution provided the greatest potential gross returns, but farm-scale net profit potential will depend on many factors including plant spacing and input costs.},

  abstract = {Demand for local food, including strawberries (Fragaria ·ananassa), is increasing throughout the United States. Strawberry production in the midwestern United States can be challenging due to the relatively short growing season and pests. However, vertical, hydroponic, high tunnel production systems could extend the growing season, minimize pest incidence, and maximize strawberry yield and profitability. The objectives of this study were to 1) identify the best cultivars and growing media for vertical, hydroponic, high tunnel production of strawberries in the midwestern United States and to 2) assess potential strategies for replacing synthetic fertilizer with organic nutrient sources in hydroponic strawberry production. To accomplish these objectives, three experiments were conducted across 2 years and two locations in Illinois to compare 11 strawberry cultivars, three soilless media mixtures, and three nutrient sources. Strawberry yield was greatest when grown in perlite mixed with coco coir or vermiculite and fertilized with a synthetic nutrient source. Yield was reduced by up to 15\% when fertilized with a bio-based, liquid nutrient source and vermicompostmixed with soilless media. Strawberry yield among cultivars varied by year and location, but Florida Radiance, Monterey, Evie 2, Portola, and Seascape were among the highest-yielding cultivars in at least one site-year. Results contribute to the development of best management practices for vertical, hydroponic, high tunnel strawberry production in the midwestern United States, but further research is needed to understand nutrient dynamics and crop physiological response among levels within vertical, hydroponic towers.},

  abstract = {To make full use of urban household balcony space, an urban aquaponics system for balconies was constructed to investigate the purification effects of four different substrates (volcanic stone, ceramic pellets, ceramic rings, and nanorods) and six plants (mung bean sprouts, hollow cabbage, water celery, lettuce, leek, and water chestnut) on fish culture wastewater. Through the determination of contaminants such as nitrogen and phosphorus and through the use of 16SrDNA sequencing technology, the substrate material and plant combinations with the best purification effects were screened. The results show that volcanic stone and nanorods have strong purification capacities. Compared to the other substrate types, there were more unique bacterial species on the surface of volcanic stone, among which amoeba species were the most dominant (92.42\%). Among the six tested plant species, mung bean sprouts had the highest contribution to nitrogen uptake (94.96\%), and water chestnut had the highest contribution to phosphorus uptake at 12.07\%. Finally, the combination of nanorods and water celery was the best at purifying the wastewater. This study provides a theoretical basis and new ideas for the construction of urban aquaponics systems on balconies, which will help to achieve green farming and the efficient utilization of water resources.},

Results show that the composition, abundance, biomass, and dominance of macrofouling organisms on EFBs exhibited significant seasonal variation. Pearson correlation analysis indicates that the abundance and biomass of the bivalve Mytilopsis sallei showed negative correlation with root biomass (p {$<$} 0.05) and particulate matter (p {$<$} 0.05). Environmental (temperature and salinity, p {$<$} 0.05) and biological (bottom-up control) factors are the main drivers of population turnover. There were significant species differences of macrofouling organisms within the different parts of the lagoon, which were attributed to environmental characteristics such as hydrodynamics, dissolved oxygen, and the degree of eutrophication. Results of this study provide a basis for controlling macrofouling organisms, while improving the stability of EFBs and the efficiency of ecological restoration.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a circulating and sustainable system that combines aquaculture and hydroponics and forms a symbiotic relationship between fish, plants, and microorganisms. We hypothesized that feed alone could support plant growth, but the symbiosis with fish adds some beneficial effects on plant growth in aquaponics. In this study, we created three closed culture systems, namely, aquaponics, hydroponics without nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and aquaculture, and added the same amount of feed containing N and P to all the treatments in order to test the hypothesis. Accumulation of NO3− and PO43− was alleviated in aquaponics and hydroponics as a result of plant uptake. Lettuce plants grown in aquaponics grew vigorously until 2 weeks and contained a constant level of N in plants throughout the production period, whereas those in hydroponics grew slowly in the early stage and then vigorously after 2 weeks with a late increment of N concentration. These results suggest that catfish help with the faster decomposition of the feed, but, in hydroponics, feed can be slowly dissolved and decomposed owing to the absence of the fish. The bacterial community structures of the culture solution were investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. At the class level, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria were the major microbial groups in the solutions. Aquaponics prevented the pollution of tank solution and maintained a higher water quality compared with hydroponics and aquaculture, suggesting that aquaponics is a more sustainable cultivation system even in a small-scale system.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a farming method that promises to be a good alternative against the food and environmental problem the world is facing. It is a combination between aquaculture (farming of fish) and hydroponics (growing plants without soil), being a technique to grow plants with the aquaculture effluent. This technique claims to have high water use efficiency, does not use pesticides and reduce the use of fertilizers, which make this technology green and sustainable. Since the interest in aquaponics is increasing, the major challenge is to do it feasible and reliable at commercial scale. The concept of precision farming usually applied in the traditional farming sense is now being introduced, leading to the need to adopt sensing, smart and IoT systems for monitoring and control of its automated processes. Lately, valuable contributions have been made towards the introduction of fully and semi-automated systems in small-scale aquaponics systems by automation and manufacturing experts. This paper aims to support research towards a viable commercial aquaponics solution by identifying, listing, and providing an in-depth explanation of each of the parameters sensed in aquaponics, and the smart systems and IoT technologies in the reviewed literature. Further, the proposed review highlights potential gaps in the research literature and future contributions to be made in regards of automated aquaponics solutions.},

  abstract = {Aquaponic nutrient studies often use various types of water containing high levels of mineral nutrients for water supply, making it difficult to accurately determine deficient nutrients limiting crop yield and quality across the systems. To avoid interference with background nutrients, we used reverse osmosis water in this study. The objectives were to identify critical nutrients that affect the yield and quality of cherry tomato-, basil-, and lettuce by characterizing nutrient composition and concentration in aquaponic systems in comparison to hydroponic systems. Daily release rate (mg L−1) of macronutrients derived from fish feed (41\% protein, 1.1\% phosphorus, 1\% fish weight) was in decreasing order of SO4–S (16) {$>$} PO4–P (2.4) {$>$} NO3–N (1.0) {$>$} K (0.8) {$>$} Cl (0.5) {$>$} NH4–N (0.4) {$>$} Ca (0.2) {$>$} NO2–N (0.13) {$>$} Na (0.11) {$>$} Mg (0.02), in which daily inputs of Mg and Ca in aquaponics were found to be only 1–2\% and 4–6\%, respectively, of those in hydroponics. Subsequently, the average concentrations of all nutrients were significantly lower in aquaponics than in hydroponics during a 3-month production except for Cl, NH4–N, NO2–N, and Na. The concentration of Mg remained below 5 mg L−1 in all aquaponic systems, while the concentration of Ca rapidly decreased in tomato-based aquaponics, especially during fruiting. SPAD value (chlorophyll content) was associated with concentrations of leaf N, Mg, and/or Ca. Specifically, lower SPAD value was correlated with lower leaf Mg and Ca for tomato and lower leaf Mg for basil but neither Mg nor Ca for lettuce. The aquaponic solution contained nearly six-times higher Na than the hydroponic solution, resulting in three-times higher Na concentration in the edible portion of the crops. Compared to a lettuce-based aquaponic system, tomato- and basil-based systems retained more desirable water quality parameters (i.e., stable pH, lower temperature), had lower electrical conductivity (EC) via greater biomass production and, therefore, more efficient nutrient removal, and had lower feed conversion rate and higher fish biomass increment. Regardless of crop species, vegetative shoot biomass was significantly reduced in aquaponics than in hydroponics. However, the marketable yield of tomatoes was similar between aquaponics and hydroponics, while those of basil and lettuce were reduced in aquaponics by 56\% and 67\%, respectively, in comparison to hydroponics. Our results highlighted potential solutions to design proper nutrient management practices essential for the development of successful aquaponic production systems. Considering that ingested fish feed does not provide sufficient levels of Mg and/or Ca for crop production, it is suggested to supplement Mg before crop transplanting and Ca before fruiting of fruity crops to improve crop growth and quality in aquaponic systems, especially when high-quality water is used for water supply.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is known to be one of the most efficient agriculture production systems by far; however, limited quantitative data are available on the level of efficiency, particularly in comparison to its counterpart, hydroponics. This study compared aquaponics with hydroponics to assess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) distributions, N- and P-use efficiency (NUE and PUE), and potential environmental impacts. Cherry tomato, basil, and lettuce were cultured in recirculating tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)based aquaponic or stand-alone hydroponic systems over a 3-month period. N and P mass balances were developed by using N and P concentrations in fish feed, solid waste, wastewater, fish biomass, and plant biomass for aquaponic systems, and chemical fertilizer, wastewater, and plant biomass for hydroponic systems, which were to estimate N and P loss from each system via denitrification and P precipitations, respectively. In aquaponics, 59e70\% of total N input was estimated to be lost via denitrification (45 e50\%), wastewater (14e20\%), and solid waste (0.7e2\%) and 30e41\% was assimilated into biomass (21 e24\% fish; 9e17\% plants). In hydroponics, 76e87\% was estimated to be lost via denitrification (69e78\%) and wastewater (7e15\%), and only 14e24\% was assimilated into biomass. Similarly, 38e54\% of total P input in aquaponics was lost via wastewater (22e28\%), precipitations (8e25\%), and solid waste (2e7\%) and 46e62\% was assimilated into biomass (35e45\% fish; 11e25\% plants). In hydroponics, 79e89\% of total P input was lost via wastewater (52e74\%) and precipitations (15e27\%), and only 11e21\% was assimilated into plant biomass. Plant species had a significant impact on N and P distribution, and tomato was most effective in removing N from wastewater and reducing denitrification via higher biomass production compared to basil and lettuce. NUE was lower for aquaponics than for hydroponics when only edible plant parts were taken into consideration, but 71e114\% higher when both fish and plant biomass were considered. Meanwhile, PUE was higher for aquaponics than for hydroponics even only when edible parts were considered and 336e369\% higher when the biomass of both crops was considered. Our N and P mass balance analyses demonstrated for the first time that aquaponics is more efficient than hydroponics. Greater N and P losses in hydroponics were mainly due to higher N and P inputs, causing 2 times higher N loss via gas emission and up to 3 times higher P loss via inorganic P in wastewater compared to aquaponics. Therefore, reducing nutrient inputs is critical in improving NUE and PUE for both aquaponics and hydroponics, which should be combined with proper crop choice, operation conditions, and management practices to further improve the efficiency of the systems.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is a rapidly growing food-production system integrating aquaculture and hydroponic crop production through an energy-intensive water recirculation process. Crop performance and yield in aquaponics are affected by essential and toxic nutrient levels in the root zone, which can be regulated by water flow rate. This study was conducted to examine the effects of hydraulic loading rate (HLR) on water quality and crop growth and yield in recirculating aquaponic systems set at three different loading rates: high (3.3 m3/m2/day; HFR, which is 12 times lower than recommended loading rate), medium (2.2 m3/m2/day; MFR), and low (1.1 m3/m2/day; LFR). Crop species varying in growth rate were examined for their optimal HLR: fast-growing Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa); medium-growing mustard (Brassica juncea) and chia (Salvia hispanica); and slow-growing basil (Ocimum basilicum) and Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris). Compared to LFR, HFR decreased water and leaf temperatures and total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) but increased dissolved oxygen and pH in aquaponic solution up to one and two weeks after transplant, respectively. HFR increased NO3–N concentration by 50 and 80\%, respectively, compared to MFR and LFR, while reducing the exposure duration of roots to ammonia (NH3–N) and its peak concentration through rapid dissipation of the toxic compound. Lower electrical conductivity (EC) in HFR during the last two weeks of production was associated with higher plant nutrient uptake and greater biomass production. The leaf greenness, photosynthetic rate (Pn), and total plant N were significantly higher at HFR than LFR. Fish growth rate, fresh weight, and feed-conversion efficiency were also increased by HFR. The growth of fast-growing crops including total fresh weight, shoot fresh weight, leaf area, and Pn was not different between HFR and MFR, while HLR had less significant effects on the growth and performance (i.e., shoot fresh weight and whole plant photosynthesis) of slow-growing crops. In conclusion, the flow rate is an important component in aquaponic crop production as it affects spatial and temporal water characteristics and subsequently determines the growth and yield of the crops. HLR at 3.3 m3/m2/day was sufficient across the crops allowing better chemical and physical properties of the aquaponic solution for maximum yield and quality. HLR should be maintained at least at 2.2 m3/m2/day for the production of fast-growing crops but can be lowered for slow-growing crops.},

To support agriculture productions when natural pollinators are not available, a methodology for realizing artificial pollination that has received considerable interest – both within the academic and commercial communities – is the utilization of autonomous robotic systems. One essential component within the complex architecture of an autonomous pollinating robot is an accurate, efficient, and robust localization and mapping subsystem (i.e., a subsystem that maps the environment and localizes the robot). This paper details the algorithmic design of a factor-graph based localization and mapping subsystem used to operate within a greenhouse environment. The presented system is validated on multiple collected data-sets both in the greenhouse and an outdoor farm.},

The aquaponics system is a modern farming system to integrate aquaculture and hydroponics into a single system to establish an environmental-friendly and lower-cost method for farming fish and vegetable all together in urban area. Water treatment in an aquaponics system is crucial to avoid mutual contamination. we proposed a modularized watercleaning device composed of all commercially available components and parts to eliminate organic contaminants by using UV-LED’s for TiO2 photo-catalyst reaction. This water-cleaning module consisted of two coaxial hollowed cylindrical pipes can be submerged completely in water for water treatment and cooling UV-LED’s. The temperature of the UV-LED after proper thermal management can be reduced about 16\% to maintain the optimal operation condition. Our preliminary experimental result by using Methylene Blue solution to simulate organic contaminants indicated that TiO2 photo-catalyst triggered by UV-LED’s can effectively decompose organic compound and decolor Methylene Blue solution.},

  abstract = {Sustainable nutrient management is of critical importance to achieve high crop yield and quality and to improve nutrient use efficiency in agricultural production systems but has not been fully established for aquaponics. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feeding regime on water quality, crop performance and yield, and nitrogen (N) use efficiency in recirculating aquaponic systems. The same amount of total N (120 g) was applied to aquaponics with different feeding regimes: aquaponic increasing feeding (AIF; the standard feeding regime), uniform feeding (AUF), and intermediate feeding (AMF), for one-month production of six vegetable and herb species. Crops grown in AIF and AUF showed contrasting results in yield and SPAD value (chlorophyll content), and therefore were further evaluated for nutrient profile in aquaponic solution and crop growth and performance compared to those in hydroponics (HYD), using eight leafy vegetable (Chinese cabbage, Mizuna, Swiss chard, lettuce, pac choi), herb (basil, chia), and fruity vegetable (cherry tomato) species. AUF improved water quality by reducing average concentrations of harmful compounds (i.e., NO2–N and Na) compared to AIF and crop growth and yield similar to those of HYD. Particularly, AUF tended to increase concentrations of mineral nutrients (i.e., NO3–N, PO4–P, Ca, and Mg) in aquaponic solution during the first week after transplanting, while decreasing the concentrations of harmful compounds in comparison to AIF. Regardless of feeding regime, aquaponics reduced fine root growth in leafy vegetables and herbs, compared to hydroponics. Overall, vegetables and herbs grown in AUF had a greater photosynthetic rate (Pn) from the first to the second week after transplanting and throughout production period and showed higher SPAD value and leaf total N content to the level similar to or slightly lower than HYD. Consequently, AUF increased N use efficiency (NUE) of the system by 30\% and up to 600\% compared to those in AIF and HYD, respectively. In conclusion, aquaponic crop production and N use efficiency can be increased by uniform feeding regime as it improves water quality and nutrient availability for better seedling establishment, consequently enhancing quality and/or yield of vegetables and herbs in aquaponics.},

This review examines fish welfare in relation to rearing water quality, fish feed and fish waste and faeces to develop a sustainable aquaponic system where the co-cultured organisms, fish, bacteria in biofilters and plants, should be considered holistically in all aquaponics operations. Water quality parameters are the primary environmental consideration for optimizing aquaponic production and for directly impacting fish welfare/health issues and plant needs. In aquaponic systems, the uptake of nutrients should be maximised for the healthy production of the plant biomass but without neglecting the best welfare conditions for the fish in terms of water quality. Measures to reduce the risks of the introduction or spread of diseases or infection and to increase biosecurity in aquaponics are also important. In addition, the possible impacts of allelochemicals, i.e., chemicals released by the plants, should be taken into account. Moreover, the effect of diet digestibility, faeces particle size and settling ratio on water quality should be carefully considered. As available information is very limited, research should be undertaken to better elucidate the relationship between appropriate levels of minerals needed by plants, and fish metabolism, health and welfare. It remains to be investigated whether and to what extent the concentrations of suspended solids that can be found in aquaponic systems can compromise the health of fish. Water quality, which directly affects fish health and well-being, is the key factor to be considered in all aquaponic systems.},

Four combinations of OS + WS, OS + SB, CR + WS, and CR + SB were evaluated. The results show that the bio-medium affects both the transfer of NH3-N to NO3-N and the biodegradation of organic matter. OS significantly increased the pH and calcium in the effluent. The SEM results revealed that OS has a layer-by-layer structure which supports the growth of a biofilm; the main component CaCO3 of OS released to the solution increases the pH, leading to good nitrification. The total organic carbon (TOC) measurement shows that both bio-media decompose organic matter to smaller than 1 k Da TOC, which provides nutrients that are readily absorbable by the vegetables. Furthermore, the water purification efficiency of RAS is OS + WS {$>$} OS + SB {$>$} CR + WS {$>$} CR + SB.},

  abstract = {This article reviews current literature published on aquaponics, a growing technology which uses aquaculture effluent to grow plants. Aquaponics offers a solution to several sustainability issues, such as, limited water availability, environmental pollution, increasing fertilizer cost, and depletion of fertile soils. The commercial and scientific application of aquaponics is growing; however, there is yet to be a review which holistically analyses scientific literature to indicate what type of system performs optimally, what will be the most dominant horticultural challenges as the commercial sector expands, and what direction of aquaponic research will be most impacting. This review analyzed over 529 publications on aquaponics, from 1978 to 2018. Through a systematic process, 257 of the most constructive publications were further analyzed and organized into varying groups based on content. The review found that in the past three 3 years, over 160 scientific articles have been published on aquaponic technology, detailing numerous trends, technological advancements and challenges associated with the system, consolidating the expansion of aquaponics and the need for a review. From publications investigating trends, it was found that decoupled aquaponic systems are becoming increasingly popular over coupled aquaponic systems, a deep water culture hydroponic component and media bed component are optimal for commercial and research applications, respectively; Tilapia and dark leafy vegetables are the most successful species used and Nitrospira may play a more important role in the aquaponic nitrification process than expected. From publications investigating challenges, it was found that commercial aquaponics will face difficulty growing high value flowering crops such as sweet peppers, tomatoes or cucumber, as a result of suboptimal nutrient ratios in aquaponic solution, specifically the reduced Kþ, Mgþ, and Caþ. Holistically, it was found that the most important aspect of aquaponics that needs future research is the role plant promoting microbes play in nutrient uptake. Considering plant growth promoting microbes are likely the cause of aquaponic plants being able to achieve yields similar to that of hydroponics, despite nutrient levels being significantly lower, future research in this field can be paramount to the beneficial use of microbes in all plant production systems.},

  abstract = {The cultivation of drug-type Cannabis sativa Lin. (C. sativa) employs a variety of rootzone systems, yet little is understood about rootzone-effects on plant physiology, inflorescence biomass, and cannabinoid potency. To determine if rootzone systems can affect C. sativa growth, physiology, and inflorescence biomass and phytochemicals, two C. sativa cultivars, colloquially known as ‘Nordle’ and ‘Sensi-Star’, were grown in three rootzone systems in a controlled environment. The three tested rootzone systems were: 1) an 11-litre pot containing a peat-based growing substrate, top fertigated with a synthetic fertilizer solution (“hydroponic”); 2) an 11-litre pot containing a peat-based growing substrate, top fertigated with aquaculture effluent solution (“aquaculture”); and 3) a 3-litre pot containing a custom made, predominantly peat-based growing substrate, with the lower portion of the roots submerged in a conventional aquaponics deep-water culture system (“aquaponics”). Throughout the experiment, plant growth (height, branch number, canopy volume), leaf-level physiological traits (e.g., chlorophyll) foliar mineral nutrition, and substrate physio-chemical properties were measured. At experimental completion, inflorescence yield (dry biomass) and potency (mass-based cannabinoid and terpene concentrations) were determined. Results revealed, significant rootzone-effects on most growth and physiological traits measured. Plants performed best in the in the hydroponic rootzone: e.g., producing 42–116\% greater inflorescence biomass than the other rootzone systems. In contrast, however, Nordle plants in the aquaponics treatment had greater Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and the terpenes ß-pinene and limonene, relative to their congeners grown in the other rootzones investigated. Pronounced differences in substrate macro-nutrient availability and foliar nutrient content occurred among the rootzones, suggesting a potential mechanism to explain the observed growth, physiological, yield and potency responses. This work underscores the importance of the rootzone environment for the cultivation of C. sativa, specifically in indoor systems focused of medical or research production.},

  abstract = {Cultivating drug-type Cannabis sativa L. with aquaponics could reduce mineral fertilizer use; however, its nutrient solution is often unbalanced and low in K+ and micronutrients. It is unknown if a K+ fertilizer, a micronutrient fertilizer, or both, would improve C. sativa production in aquaponic solution, as optimal K+ and micronutrient concentrations in the root zone for C. sativa during the flowering stage have not been investigated. To determine the effects of adding a K+ fertilizer and a micronutrient fertilizer to aquaponic solution for C. sativa production, we grew drug-type C. sativa in five aquaponic based solutions: aquaponic solution (control plants) (15 mg·L−1 K+); aquaponic solution with added micronutrients (Fe3+, Cu2+, Mn2+, B3+, Mo3+, and Zn2+); and aquaponic solution with added micronutrients and three K+ concentrations (75, 113, and 150 mg·L−1) during the flowering stage. To evaluate the impact of additional K+ and micronutrients on C. sativa production, we measured growth (vegetative parameters and weight), physiology (leaf gas exchange), leaf nutrition content, and yield (inflorescence weight). Adding the K+ fertilizer at 75 and 113 mg·L−1 with micronutrients to aquaponic solution increased harvest index (marketable inflorescence to shoot weight) by 16\% and 22\% compared with the control, respectively. Cannabis sativa dry apical inflorescence and total inflorescence yield also increased linearly with increasing K+ concentration. Alternatively, plants grown in the control (suboptimal K+ and micronutrient conditions) had no difference in growth or measured physiological parameters compared with plants with supplemented nutrients. Our study suggests that aquaponic solution mitigates low K+ concentrations from causing deficiency.},

  abstract = {Bacillus subtilis HS3 and Bacillus mycoides EC18 are two rhizosphere-associated bacteria with plant growth-promoting activity. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was implemented to study various aspects of plant-microbe interaction mechanisms of these two environmental isolates. The results show that fengycin and surfactin are involved in the antifungal activity of B. subtilis HS3. Moreover, this strain emits several other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than 2,3-butanediol, contributing to plant growth promotion. CLSM (Confocal laser scanning microscopy) observations of the GFP-labelled strain showed that HS3 selectively colonizes root hairs of grass (Lolium perenne) in a hydroponic system. For B. mycoides EC18, we found that the wild-type EC18 strain and a ∆asbA (petropectin-deficient) mutant, but not the ∆dhbB (bacillibactin-deficient) and ADKO (asbA and dhbB double knockout) mutants, can increase the plant biomass and total chlorophyll. All the mutant strains have a reduced colonization capability on Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) roots, at the root tip and root hair region compared to the wild-type strain. These results indicate that the siderophore, bacillibactin, is involved in the plant growth promoting activity and could affect the root colonization of B. mycoides. Collectively, the CRISPR-Cas9 system we developed for environmental isolates is broadly applicable and will facilitate deciphering the mechanisms of Bacillus-plant interactions.},

  abstract = {Fish are considered to be sentient and capable of perceiving and experiencing pain. Fish welfare in farming conditions can be interpreted with regard to ethics, economic viability, legal issues and consumer’s perspectives. Fish welfare is directly related with the economic inputs such as stocking density, mortality and growth rate, affecting the profitability of the aquaponics systems. Therefore, fish welfare has a strong economic dimension in an overall sustainability of aquaponics systems. Thus, there is a growing understanding of a link between fish welfare and feasibility of the fish production systems. The economic achievement of aquaponics production may be linked to fish welfare, particularly with regard to preclude the fish diseases. Sustainable and profitable production of aquaponics can be challenged by poor welfare of fish. The poor welfare might lead to higher yield variation, resulting in poor economic gain. The strategies that can be adopted to protect fish welfare can increase profits and productivity of the aquaponics systems. Fish welfare practices should be considered to improve the production performance in aquaponics.},

The experiment as the first scientific aquaponics study in Turkey was conducted at the Ankara University, Faculty of Agriculture, using in-door, small-scale classical aquaponic systems. Ninety six tilapia juveniles (O. aureus) were stocked at different ratio; 25 kg/m3 (Group I), 35 kg/m3 (Group II) and 50 kg/m3 (Group III) and fed with 45\% raw protein feed at the level of 2\% body weight for 126 days. Fish density affected the fish growth parameters and the most densiest group showed the best results in terms of fish growth and feed efficiency. Water quality parameters measured fluctated during the experiment even the exceed of the optimal ranges for the fish. However, tilapia tolerated the changes of water quality. Total plant biomass was low with the various limiting factors including insufficient lighting of in-door aquaponics system and low level of water potassium. The results of this study clearly illustrate the fish stocking rate has an impact on total biomass in the aquaponics and in one-loop aquaponics the water quality fluctation is the main challenging factor.},

Finding new ways to increase agricultural production in a sustainable manner is required. The current study suggests a conceptual model to integrate established recirculating aquaculture practices into a near-zero discharge aquaponic system that efficiently utilizes water, excreted nutrients and organic matter for energy. The suggested model allows to significantly extend the planted area and recover energy in the form of biogas to operate the system off-grid. A mass balance model of nitrogen, carbon and energy was established and solved, based on data from the literature. Results demonstrate that a fish standing stock of about 700 kg would produce 3.4 tons of fish annually and enough nutrients to grow about 35 tons of tomatoes per year (chosen as a model plant) and recover sufficient energy (70 kWh/day) to run the system on biogas and use less water. If proven successful, this approach may play a major role in sustainably enhancing food security in rural and water scarce regions.},

  abstract = {Knowledge Transfer Program for the construction and maintenance of integrated farming utilizing aquaponics system has been conducted between Universiti Malaysia Pahang, the local school community partner (Al-Irsyad Islamic School) and science school Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah, Kuantan. The knowledge transfer approach was a blending between the use of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and active (hands-on) participation of the university students and community members to enhance the knowledge transfer experience. Teachers, school students and university final year industrial biotechnology students have participated in the program. The trainer used a free 3D design Google Sketch Up to enhance spatial (3D) understanding of the students in the essential components of the device and the working mechanism. The trained university students were also assessed using Moodle internet-based Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) that has been actively used by academics in UMP. Subsequently, the final year university students applied the knowledge they have learned and trained during the weeks by engaging the local school students in the Knowledge Transfer Program activities (workshops). A total of fifty-six (56) university students have engaged and trained 98 secondary school students (47\% female, 53\% male) with age from 13 years old (26\%) to above 16 yearsold (13\%). It shows that 93\% of the students agreed to have received new skills (basic aquaponics system construction) by this outdoor and hands-on Knowledge Transfer activities, conducted by the senior (university) students. The data also indicated that 82\% of the students have an increased appreciation to science due to the application and peer-demonstration of the system. From the video recorded, the school students were able to construct aquaponics system in a team environment without receiving further assistance. This indicates that hands-on and teamwork constructions of a product or technology have significant impacts to the cognitive learning (understanding) in Knowledge Transfer activities.},

It is expected that environment friendly technology will be developed for integration of pak choy cultivation and freshwater catfish production (Clarias sp.). The aims of the study are to determine the types of organic planting media and aquaponics watering system that is able to provide sufficient nutrients to the integrated agriculture system. Four organic materials from agricultural wastes e.g. shavings woods, coconut husk, coconut shell biochar and coffee shell biochar were used for growing media. Two aquaponic watering systems with catfish rearing were combined with the organic materials as planting media in a factorial randomized block design of experiment. Addition of organic materials into growing media of pak choy is necessary in the aquaponic system because besides make the media better texture, they also provide nutrients to the plant, particularly the phosphorus. Between the organic materials, coconut shell biochar was high content in phosphorus, while coffee shell biochar in potassium. The experiment also concluded that water circulation has no effect on the nutrition concentration in the aquaponic system.},

  abstract = {This project presents the Internet of Things (IoT) applications as instrumentations to automate traditional aquaponics environment. Presently, Malaysia’s economic situation during COVID19 is facing a significant amount of demand for food production. Research has shown that Aquaponics can help solve this problem by increasing conventional farming efficiencies and increasing food production to Malaysia’s local community. However, extensive and arduous labours have made Aquaponics costly, especially for small farmers and hobbyists, making it inaccessible to specific groups or individuals. This study aims to provide automation to the Aquaponicsenvironment by developing an IoT based prototype to monitor and gather parameter data involving water level, humidity and temperature in the Aquaponics ecology. The tendencies and trends in Aquaponics systems can be analysed using the parameter mentioned. The project features sensors like two water level sensors, liquid temperature sensor, and humidity sensor to collect parameters wirelessly by using an ESP 8266 that would trigger the actuators when certain events are met. The actuator would serve as the balance check for the symbiotic ecology and accommodating parameter it lacks based on the sensor data. Moreover, the project is divided into three different development phases: setting up normal aquaponics ecology; implementing automation in aquaponics systems; and analysing data from the prototype’s sensor. Therefore, this solution is expected to increase efficiencies in the Aquaponics environment with less human intervention, reducing labour costs in Aquaponics and producing more organic and healthy yield. The project would significantly impact the local community, especially during this pandemic outbreak where food production is considerably on demand. The yield from Aquaponics is unquestionably nutritious, and health enthusiasts will surely benefit from this project.},

To reduce the electrical energy consumption, the project carries out from the solar energy to make it more economical and safe. Furthermore, the system has many benefits. First, the crops are chemical-free as the nutrients from the fish acts as the fertilizer for the growing plant. The pH value of the water in fish tank will always persistent because of the circulating process. It also can be developed anywhere because it only requires a small space of area. Farmers can save the budget to spend on utility bills at the end of the month because the system applies renewable sources to generate energy. Lastly, aquaponics used minimal labor because man does not need to look after their grown crops for fertilizing, weeding or watering the plants.},

  abstract = {The overexploitation of wild plants for medicinal uses and conventional agricultural farming methods, which use high amounts of water, fertilizers, and pesticides, have had devastating environmental consequences. This study aimed to evaluate the prospects of using aquaponics and hydroponics as alternative approaches to soil cultivation by comparing the crop yields, secondary metabolite contents, and the antifungal activities of ethanol extracts of Helichrysum odoratissimum (L.) Sweet, a widely used medicinal plant species in Southern Africa. Six-week-old H. odoratissimum seedlings were grown in aquaponic and hydroponic systems. The growth parameters, secondary metabolite contents, and antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum were assessed. The results for crop yield (plant height, fresh and dry weights) and the tissue nutrient contents did not change substantially (p {$>$} 0.05) between aquaponic and hydroponic treatments. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis showed that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were the most abundant compounds in H. odoratissimum; however, no statistical difference was observed among the field, hydroponic, and aquaponic plants (DF = 2; χ2 = 2.67; p {$>$} 0.05). While there was no significant difference in polyphenol contents among the three treatments, remarkably, the flavonol contents in the leaves varied significantly (DF = 2; χ2 = 6.23; p {$<$} 0.05) among the three treatments. A higher flavonol content occurred in leaves from the hydroponic system than in leaves from the aquaponic (p {$<$} 0.05) and field (p {$>$} 0.05) systems. The MIC results showed that the ethanolic extract of H. odoratissimum was fungistatic against F. oxysporum; however, this effect was more prominent in the ethanol extracts of plants grown in the aquaponic system, with a mean MIC value of 0.37 ± 0.00 mg/mL The key findings of this study are that aquaponically cultivated plants exhibited the best antifungal activity, while higher total flavonol contents occurred in the hydroponically cultivated plants. In conclusion, aquaponics and hydroponics performed better or similar to field cultivation and are viable alternative methods for cultivating H. odoratissimum plants.},

However, only fragmentary information is available about the use of BSF meal-based diets in sturgeon nutrition. In consideration of a circular economy concept and a more sustainable aquaculture development, the present research represents the first comprehensive multidisciplinary study on the physiological effects of a BSF diet during sturgeon culture in an aquaponic system. Siberian sturgeon (               Acipenser baerii               ) juveniles were fed over a 60-days feeding trial on a control diet (Hi0) and a diet containing 50\% of full-fat BSF meal respect to fish meal (Hi50). Physiological responses of fish were investigated using several analytical approaches, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, histology, Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), microbiome sequencing and Real-time PCR.

  abstract = {The recovery of nutrients from residual fish sludge in aquaponics could achieve zero solid waste discharge and supplement additional nutrients to hydroponics, thus yielding environmental and economic benefits. In this study, novel biological aerated filters (BAFs) with ceramsite plus different lignocellulosic materials (corn straw, wheat straw, and sawdust) are designed and installed in aquaponic systems. The BAFs performed the fish sludge separation and nutrient conversion in a single equipment without the necessity for backwashing. The potential for nutrient recovery from fish sludge is evaluated by comparing four BAFs filled with different media. The BAF with ceramsite plus sawdust achieves the highest mineralization capacity based on nitrification and dissolved total phosphorus. The average concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S macronutrients reach 12.3\%, 11.8\%, 4.5\%, 26.4\%, 22.6\%, and 46.0\% of those of Hoagland nutrient solution, respectively. The recovered Fe, Mn, and B micronutrients are 10.0\%, 12.0\%, and 18.0\%, respectively, whereas Cu, Zn, and Mo are 1.5, 1.8, and 1.0 times, respectively, of those of Hoagland nutrient solution. The estimated nutrient recoveries of Ca, Mg, and S have good performance efficiencies, followed by K and Cu; those of N, P, Fe, Mn, and Zn have potentials for further improvement. The modified aquaponics with BAFs are proposed for the recovery of both dissolved and solid nutrients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution is a global issue severely constraining aquaculture practices, not only deteriorating the aquatic environment but also threatening the aquaculture production. One promising solution is adopting aquaponics systems where a synergy can be established between aquaculture and aquatic plants for metal sorption, but the interactions of multiple metals in such aquatic plants are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the absorption behaviors of Cu(II) and Cd(II) in water by water hyacinth roots in both single- and binary-metal systems. Cu(II) and Cd(II) were individually removed by water hyacinth roots at high efficiency, accompanied with release of protons and cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. However, in a binary-metal arrangement, the Cd(II) sorption was significantly inhibited by Cu(II), and the higher sorption affinity of Cu(II) accounted for its competitive sorption advantage. Ionic exchange was identified as a predominant mechanism of the metal sorption by water hyacinth roots, and the amine and oxygen-containing groups are the main binding sites accounting for metal sorption via chelation or coordination. This study highlights the interactive impacts of different metals during their sorption by water hyacinth roots and elucidates the underlying mechanism of metal competitive sorption, which may provide useful implications for optimization of phytoremediation system and development of more sustainable aquaculture industry.},

  abstract = {Nutrient recycling from biowaste is one of the sustainable approaches to managing waste. The aquaponic system is one of the nutrient recycling methods that can reduce water consumption and reuse the nutrient available in its ecosystem. The nutrient to fertilize the plant in aquaponic depends on the activities of microbes to convert the waste into the nutrient. To enhance the growth of the plants, some aquaponics systems still rely on chemical fertilizers. Kappaphycus alvarezii is one of the red seaweeds abundantly found in East Malaysia. After numerous processes such as carrageenan extraction, the biowaste derived from K. alvarezii still contains a nutrient that can be recycled. The present study explores the potential of K. alvarezii solid waste as fertilizer to grow Ocimum basilicum in an aquaponics system. In this study, the macro- and micronutrients in K. alvarezii solid waste were determined, and the prevalence of microbes in the aquaponics system was monitored using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and 16S metagenomic sequencing method, respectively. Based on the findings, the growth of O. basilicum supplemented with K. alvarezii biofertilizer was significantly higher than the negative control. For genetic expression study in O. basilicum, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and cytochrome p450 reductase (CPR) genes were upregulated. The O. basilicum is free from mycotoxin and heavy metals. Since K. alvarezii solid waste is rich with macro- and micronutrients, which are essential for plant growth and can enhance the growth of O. basilicum, K. alvarezii solid waste produced from bioethanol production could be a potential fertilizer.},

Therefore, this paper mainly studied the application of the Aquaponics system to farms. This paper can be divided into four parts. First, the supportive policies of the government for the system; Second, people's attitude towards the system; Third, profitability of the project; Fourth, advantages and disadvantages. As these can be seen from the following four points, the government has relevant supporting policies, and people have different attitudes towards this system, but most of them are still supportive. In terms of profitability, new shareholding policies are adopted, and more efficient cultivation technologies are used to minimize risks. Such a system does not require pesticides or labor, which maximizes costs in both areas.},

This study aimed to investigate the performance of a novel off-grid aquaponics system with near-zero water and waste discharge, focusing on the carbon cycle and energy recovery that was achieved by the addition of onsite anaerobic treatment of the solid waste streams. Following a stabilization stage, the system was closely monitored for four months. Fish tank water was recirculated via solid and nitrification reactors, from which 66\% was recycled to the fish tank directly and 34\% indirectly through the hydroponically grown plants. Fish solid waste was anaerobically treated, energy was recovered, and the nutrient-rich supernatant was recycled to the plants to enhance production. Plant waste was also digested anaerobically for further recovery of energy and nutrients. Fish stocking density was 15.3 and over time reached approximately 40 kg/m3 where it was maintained. Feed (45\% protein content) was applied daily at 2\% of body weight. Typical fish performance was observed with a survival rate {$>$}97\% and feed conversion ratio of 1.33. Lettuce production was up to 5.65 kg/m2, significantly higher than previous reports, largely because of high nutrients reuse efficiency from the anaerobic supernatant that contained 130 and 34 mg/L N and P, respectively. Of the feed carbon, 24.5\% was taken up by fish biomass.},

Therefore, efficient use of this waste would be advantageous. This study aimed at investigating anaerobic digestion of aquqponic lettuce waste to recover nutrients and energy through biogas production. A 700 L commercial anaerobic system was used to treat lettuce wastes from an aquaponic farming system that operated under desert climate and steady-state conditions. Digestion efficiency of the lettuce waste was 90.1\% by weight, producing a maximum biogas volume of 0.65 m3/kg dry weight per day. Biogas composition contained on average 59.2\% methane and 38.9\% CO2 with only negligible hydrogen sulfide content. Moreover, the supernatant from the anaerobic digester contained elevated nutrient concentrations (N, P, K, Ca, and Fe), which can potentially be used onsite as a fertilizer. Onsite anaerobic digestion of lettuce plant waste from the aquaponic system under summer desert conditions is demonstrated for the first time to efficiently reduce pollution burden, produce high-quality biogas, and recover nutrients.},

  abstract = {Global challenges such as lack of arable land, soil degradation, water scarcity, nutrient depletion and climate change are compromising agricultural productivity. Besides, there is increased demand for innovative and sustainable food production systems to increase food productivity for rapidly growing population. Aquaponics is a new method of food production which uses aquaculture wastewater to produce crops, thus reducing the need for irrigation and provides nutrients for the growth of plants. This study examined the growth of sweet worm wood, pigweed and pumpkin and their ability as part of biological filters for intensive production of Nile tilapia. Physical and chemical parameters were monitored at the influent and effluent of the hydroponic system. The final wet weight of the plants was measured, and growth of fish monitored biweekly. The plants grew rapidly with no signs of nutrient deficiency during the experimental period. There was a significant variation in wet weight of the three plants (P ˂ 0.05). Sweet worm wood had the highest weight which corresponded to high nitrate uptake by the plant with 73.43\% ± 3.92 nitrate extraction efficiency. However, there was no significant variation in the reduction of ammonia, nitrates and nitrites (P˃ 0.05) in the three treatments. Phosphorus reduction varied among the three treatments (P˂ 0.05) with pumpkin extracting more phosphorus. The highest extraction corresponded with fruiting stage of the plant. The study indicates that aquaponics can recover nutrients sufficient for the growth of plants.},

  abstract = {Aquaponics is considered to be a promising production system in the future, due to its high nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE). In this study, lab-scale aquaponic systems with native species, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and pakchoi (Brassica chinensis), were achieved successfully in northern China. And nitrogen transformations in aquaponics during summer and autumn were thoroughly investigated. High fish and plant yields were observed in summer because of suitable environment. However, seasonal variation has minimal effect on NUE, which was 43.8 ± 5.9\% and 44.6 ± 3.7\% in summer and autumn, respectively. Similar phenomenon occurred for N2O. N2O emission flux of aquaponics was 508.2 ± 80.6 ug m−2 h−1 in summer, and decreased to 218.5 ± 30.6 ug m−2 h−1 in autumn, whereas the N2O conversion ratio changed from 1.6 ± 0.2\% to 1.3 ± 0.1\%, correspondingly. This was mainly because of the decrease of nitrogen input at lower temperature. TAN concentration was lower in summer (0.5 mg/l) than autumn (1.0 mg/l), indicating faster nitrification occurred at higher temperature. And NO3−-N concentrations showed an obvious increase and decrease period in summer but only a slow increase in autumn, which was ascribed to the effect of seasonal variation on the balance between nitrification, denitrification and plant growth. Results of this study could provide theoretical supports of aquaponics’ seasonal performance for aquaponics’ application in northern China.},

  abstract = {To investigate the effects of pH on performance and nitrogen transformations in aquaponics, mediabased aquaponics operated at pH 6.0, 7.5 and 9.0 were systematically examined and compared in this study. Results showed that nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) reached its maximum of 50.9\% at pH 6.0, followed by 47.3\% at pH 7.5 and 44.7\% at pH 9.0. Concentrations of nitrogen compounds (i.e., TAN, NOÀ2 -N and NOÀ3 -N) in three pH systems were all under tolerable levels. pH had significant effect on N2O emission and N2O conversion ratio decreased from 2.0\% to 0.6\% when pH increased from 6.0 to 9.0, mainly because acid environment would inhibit denitrifiers and lead to higher N2O emission. 75.2–78.5\% of N2O emission from aquaponics was attributed to denitrification. In general, aquaponics was suggested to maintain pH at 6.0 for high NUE, and further investigations on N2O mitigation strategy are needed.},

  abstract = {N2O production in aquaponics is an inevitable concern when aquaponics is developed as a future production system. In the present study, two attempts were applied to mitigate N2O emission from aquaponics, i.e., aeration in hydroponic bed (HA) and addition of polylactic acid (PLA) into fillers (PA). Results showed that N2O emission from HA and PA was decreased by 47.1−58.1\% and 43.2−74.9\% respectively compared with that in control. Denitrification was proved to be the main emission pathway in all treatments, representing 62.4\%, 86.4\%, and 75.8\% of the total N2O emission in HA, PA, and control, respectively. However, production of plants in HA was severely impaired, which was only 3.04 ± 0.39 kg/m2, while in PA and control, plants yields were 4.87 ± 0.56 kg/m2 and 4.33 ± 0.58 kg/m2. Combining the environmental and economic benefits, adding PLA in aquaponics may have a better future when developing and applying aquaponics systems.},

  abstract = {The present paper contributes to the modeling aquaculture. The paper main objectives are to identify an analysis smart water aquaponics. The purpose is to add more value to end aquaponics products. Aquaculture production depends on physical, chemical and biological qualities of pond water to a greater extent. The successful pond management requires an understanding of water quality. Intensification of pond makes the water quality undesirable with a number of water quality parameters. The objective of this model is to test and predicts plant and fish growth and net ammonium and nitrate concentrations in water in an aquaponic system. This is done by comparing the model outputs with measurements under controlled conditions in order to assess the accuracy of the tool to simulate nutrient concentrations in water and fish and plant biomass production of the system.},

Orientations in terms of communication aims product-focused and aim at enhancing the reputation of products, consequently with impact on product consumption. The present research is focused on the aquaponics products, regardless of their presentation - fresh, frozen or processed. This paper conducted a questionnaire survey of Romanian consumers' perception of aquaponics products. The empirical study for aquaponics products indicated box that consumers shown different awareness to domestic and foreign aquaponics products. Aquaponics national products got more attention from the consumers. Foreign aquaponics products had insightful higher price, but Romanian aquaponics products acquired insightful higher value, and got a better rank in the preference list and in the purchase intention of the consumers.},
