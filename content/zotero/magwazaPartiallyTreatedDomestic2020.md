## Abstract

Using efﬂuent from the anaerobic bafﬂed reactor (ABR) of the decentralised wastewater treatment system (DEWATS) as a sole nutrient source is not sufﬁcient for tomato plants grown in hydroponic system. The study investigated the effects of commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix (CHFM) combined with ABR efﬂuent on tomato growth and yield. A media-based hydroponic technique consisting of three treatments, namely, ABR efﬂuent, CHFM, and ABR efﬂuent combined with CHFM (ABR þ CHFM (50:50 v/v) was used. The results showed that plant growth parameters, biomass, fruit yield and shoot nutrient content were signiﬁcantly higher in tomato plants fed with CHFM and ABR þ CHFM than those grown in ABR efﬂuent. Addition of 50 % dose of CHFM in ABR wastewater (ABR þ CHFM) increased shoot N, K, Ca and Zn. These results indicated that adding 50% CHFM can alleviate nutrient deﬁciencies when partially treated wastewater from anaerobic digester is used as a nutrient source for hydroponic tomato cultivation.
