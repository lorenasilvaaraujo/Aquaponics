## Abstract

Decoupled aquaponic systems are gaining popularity as a way to manage water quality in aquaponic systems to suit plant and ﬁsh growth independently. Aquaponic systems are known to be deﬁcient in several plant-essential elements, which can be aﬀected by solution pH to either increase or decrease available nutrients. To determine the eﬀect of pH in a decoupled aquaponic system, a study was conducted using aquaculture eﬄuent from tilapia culture tanks at four pH treatments: 5.0, 5.8, 6.5, and 7.0, used to irrigate a cucumber crop. Growth and yield parameters, nutrient content of the irrigation water, and nutrients incorporated into the plant tissue were collected over two growing seasons. pH did not have a practical eﬀect on growth rate, internode length or yield over the two growing seasons. Availability and uptake of several nutrients were aﬀected by pH, but there was no overarching eﬀect that would necessitate its use in commercial systems. Nutrient concentrations in the aquaculture eﬄuent would be considered low compared to hydroponic solutions; however, elemental analysis of leaf tissues was within the recommended ranges. Research into other nutrient sources provided by the system (i.e., solid particles carried with the irrigation water) would provide further information into the nutrient dynamics of this system.
