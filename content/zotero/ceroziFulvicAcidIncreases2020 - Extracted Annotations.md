Iron is generally supplemented in the form of synthetic iron chelates (Fe-EDTA, Fe-DTPA or Fe-EDDHA); however, little attention has been paid to exactly why this supplementation is necessary for aquaponics operations (Bartelme et al., 2018).

An aquaponic solution was added with levels of fulvic acid (0, 69, 138, 345, and 690 mg L −1 ), and analyzed for dissolved iron after incubation and centrifugation. ([Cerozi 2020:102091](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=1))

Solution pH had no effect on iron availability with the absence of fulvic acid; in its presence, the effect of pH was only significant at values below 4.5. ([Cerozi 2020:102091](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=1))

Using tilapia and lettuce as a prime combination in aquaponics, and parameters from the literature (Table 1), it was assumed that for every plant growth cycle of 28 days, there is an influx of 25.2 mg m−2 of Fe in the aquaponic solution from thefish feed, while lettuce plants accumulate 22.2 mg m−2 of Fe in the dry biomass produced, thus generating a virtual surplus of 3.0 mg m−2 of Fe in the system.

9 % of iron was present in the solid waste, with just a small fraction dissolved in aquaculture wastewater (Goddek et al., 2018), likely due to the formation of insoluble iron oxides followed by iron precipitation ([Cerozi 2020:102092](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=2))

The pH was maintained at 6.8 ([Cerozi 2020:102092](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=2))

Fulvic acid (Soluble Fulvic Acid, Ferti-Organic, Brownsville, TX, USA) was dissolved at concentrations of 0, 20, 40, 125 and 250 mg in in 200-mL aliquots from the previously described aquaponic solution sample, and incubated for one hour at 25 °C. ([Cerozi 2020:102092](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=2))

Visual MINTEQ demonstrated that the increase of fulvic acid concentrations resulted in higher iron complexation and predominance of soluble iron forms (Fig. 3), corroborating thefindings obtained with the iron experiment. However, the fulvic acid concentrations used on the model did not match the concentrations used on the experiment to promote the same effect on iron solubilization. On the geochemical model, the highest Fe solubilization was obtained with 80 mg L−1 of fulvic acid whereas 690 mg L−1 of fulvic acid tested in the experiment solubilized approximately 59 % of the iron that was included. ([Cerozi 2020:102094](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=4))

Visual MINTEQ results demonstrated that the pH of aquaponic nutrient solutions appeared to have little effect on iron solubility in the presence of fulvic acid and almost no influence in its absence ([Cerozi 2020:102094](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=4))

n the absence of fulvic acid, lowering the pH from 6.55 to 3.5 had almost no effect on increasing Fe solubility according to Visual MINTEQ simulations, when only 0.032 % of iron solubilized ([Cerozi 2020:102094](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=4))

[[Disagreement]]: This contradicts some reports on the literature hypothesizing that the low iron availability in aquaponics is due to an alkaline pH of the solution (Roosta and Mohsenian, 2012). ([Cerozi 2020:102094](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2HS4Y9G?page=4))
