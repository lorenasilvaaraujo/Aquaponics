## Abstract

In the present study, we evaluated the eﬀects of two stocking densities (low - ALD, 3.81 kg m−3 vs. high - AHD, 7.26 kg m−3) on the growth, health, and ﬂesh quality of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the yield and microbiological quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) produced in a low-tech aquaponic system compared to hydroponic cultivation (HYP). Nine experimental units (three replications per treatment) were utilised. A total of 123 rainbow trout (initial body weight: 142 ± 35 g) were randomly distributed in six 500-L tanks (3 per stocking density) and monitored during a 117 day trial period. The ﬁnal weight (331 g on average), speciﬁc growth rate (0.73% d−1), feed conversion ratio (1.58), and mortality (3%) of the ﬁsh did not diﬀer between stocking densities. The morphometric indices, slaughter results, and ﬂesh quality were not aﬀected. Similarly, the quantity of lettuce produced during two consecutive cycles was similar among treatments (2.4 kg m−2 on average). At harvest, microbial contamination (total viable count, E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, mould, and yeasts) was similar in the ﬁsh skin and lettuce produced in aquaponic systems with diﬀerent stocking densities, as well as in the lettuce produced in aquaponic and hydroponic systems. In conclusion, rainbow trout and lettuce productions were successful in the tested aquaponic system, whereas stocking density did not aﬀect ﬁsh growth or ﬂesh quality.
