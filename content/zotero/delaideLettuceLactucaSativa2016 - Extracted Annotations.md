> >Nutrient composition and yield comparison between 3 systems (hydroponics, aquaponics and decoupled aquaponics). Also analyzes root and shoot weight. ([note on p.467)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65X5SIFA?page=1)

Aquaponic systems designed with independent loops offer greater control over the hydroponic component, where water can be complemented with mineral salts for increased nutrient concentrations, and pH adjusted to fall within an optimal range. ([Delaide et al 2016:467](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65X5SIFA?page=1))

- [ ] According to Liebig's 'law of the minimum' nutrient availability constitutes a critical factor; the nutrient least available determines the maximum growth rate. ([Delaide et al 2016:468](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65X5SIFA?page=2))

climate-controlled experimental greenhouse ([Delaide et al 2016:468](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65X5SIFA?page=2))

air temperature and relative humidity in the greenhouse were recorded every 30 min ([Delaide et al 2016:468](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65X5SIFA?page=2))

15-day-old Latin-type lettuce seedlings (Lactuca Sativa 'Sucrine', Semailles, Faulx-Les-Tombes, Belgium) were placed into the AeroFlo and harvested after 36 days ([Delaide et al 2016:469](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65X5SIFA?page=3))

In line with previous studies [15,16] these results confirm AP systems as an alternative to conventional hydroponic systems, producing similar yields. Importantly, this study shows that considerable lower nutrient concentrations and different macronutrient ratios in AP solution did not alter yields.
