## Abstract

Aquaponics is a human-made recirculating ecosystem that integrates the cultivation of crops and aquaculture to produce higher-quality, safe, and nutritious food. However, limited studies have been conducted to investigate the performance of diﬀerent aquaponic plant growing systems. As such, the current research focuses on evaluating the overall performance of four diﬀerent aquaponic growing systems in the growth and yield of lettuce and pak choi. The data on the shoot and root biomass and growth parameters were collected, and the growth analysis was performed. The relative growth rate results indicated that the appropriate environmental conditions were provided for lettuce and pak choi to grow successfully in all the four aquaponic growing systems. The crop growth rate results revealed that all four aquaponic growing systems tested in this experiment were able to grow crops and provide yield successfully. However, the substrate-based closed capillary water distribution system (CCWD) had the best overall result, which showed great potential for aquaponic applications to promote alternative agriculture production under unfavored climate conditions.
