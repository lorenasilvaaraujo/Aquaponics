high earning consumers demand quality diets composed of a large share of proteins, fats, and oils. ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100350](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=2))

Estimates suggested that Qatar imported approximately 90% of its food. ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100350](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=2))

Single Recirculating Aquaponics System (SRAP) (One-loop/ Traditional Aquaponics System). ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100351](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=3))

Utilization of sludge digesters is another key way of maximizing efficiency through the reuse of solid wastes ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100351](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=3))

here is a steady development of new technologies with the capacity to improve the profitability of aquaponics systems ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100352](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=4))

given that aquaponics systems address agricultural waste management, food production using aquaponics systems is ideal in places where there is a cost attached to waste disposal and nutrient emissions ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100352](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=4))

good location can facilitate cost savings of an aquaponics enterprise when land acquisition costs are low, setting up the system within the vicinity of urban and peri-urban areas. ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100353](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=5))

Qatar National Food Security Program (QNFSP). This food security strategy seeks to guide Qatar in achieving self-sufficiency by the year 2025. ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100353](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=5))

investments in research and development ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100353](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=5))

forming research alliances both at a regional and international level will helpfill the gaps in knowledge and sharing of researchfindings. In Oman, the collaboration between local institutions and foreign private companies helped launch one of the few large-scale aquaponics systems in the Gulf region. T ([Abusin and Mandikiana 2020:100353](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7JBH3GY?page=5))

potential to create new jobs through backward and forward linkages. For instance, it could lead to the emergence offish feed companies, development of organic farmers markets, and agro-tourism ventures that champion sustainability among current and future generations alike.
