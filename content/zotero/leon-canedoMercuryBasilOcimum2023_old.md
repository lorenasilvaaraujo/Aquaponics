## Abstract

The accumulation, mass balances, and potential health risks associated with the presence of Hg were evaluated in basil cultivated simultaneously with shrimp by aquaponics (~1.7 g L‚àí 1). Two aquaponic (well water (WW) and diluted seawater (DSW)) treatments and one hydroponic control (hydroponic solution (HS)) were examined. The trend of Hg accumulated in basil tissues was roots > leaves > stems. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found between aquaponic treatments. Mercury concentrations in the edible basil tissues were below the maximum allowable levels (0.2 mg kg‚àí 1) for vegetables established by international guidelines (WHO, 2007; CREU, 2018). The mass balances evidenced that most Hg (> 99%) entered the aquaponic system through the input water, while the main output route (> 90%) was through the zeolite used in plants. Mercury inorganic speciation in water was similar between WW and DSW treatments. The dominating speciation was HgCl2 (50%), which is a bioavailable form that biota can use. In the HS treatment, the chemical speciation was different as it formed complexes mainly with ammonia. The health risk index for Hg was < 1.0, which indicates that the population exposed to the consumption of basil grown with shrimp would not be at risk.
