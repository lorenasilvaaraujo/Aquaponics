aquaponic system compared to hydroponic cultivation ([Birolo et al 2020:735653](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=1))

rainbow trout and lettuce productions were successful in the tested aquaponic system, whereas stocking density did not affect fish growth orflesh quality ([Birolo et al 2020:735653](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=1))

under a natural photoperiod, and lasted 117 days ([Birolo et al 2020:735654](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=2))

At the time offish slaughter, leaves from all plants (i.e. those of the second cycle) were collected and pooled ([Birolo et al 2020:735655](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=3))

1.98 vs. 1.75 kg m −2 ([Birolo et al 2020:735656](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=4))

2.82 ([Birolo et al 2020:735656](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=4))

The marketable lettuce yield was 2.82 ± 0.64 kg m −2 at the end of thefirst cycle and 1.89 ± 0.18 kg m −2 at the end of the second cycle (average of the three groups). ([Birolo et al 2020:735656](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=4))

even if a higher production was recorded in aquaponic units compared to hydroponic ones in the second cycle ([Birolo et al 2020:735656](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=4))

The chemical, physical, and microbiological indicators proved that food-safe products can be obtained from a low-tech aquaponic system. ([Birolo et al 2020:735660](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=8))
