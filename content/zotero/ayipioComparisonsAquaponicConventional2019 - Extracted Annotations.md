The results showed that although crop yield in AP was lower than conventional cHP, the dierence was not statistically significant. ([Ayipio et al 2019:6511](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YDDD8GYQ?page=1))

significant eects of aquatic organism, hydroponic system type, and nutrient supplementation used in the studies on crop yield comparisons. ([Ayipio et al 2019:6511](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YDDD8GYQ?page=1))

focus on crop productivity ([Ayipio et al 2019:6512](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YDDD8GYQ?page=2))

Factors such as fish species, feed protein content, flow rates, aquaculture euent pH [21], fish density [22], feeding rate [23], and AP coupling type, among other factors, greatly contribute to variability in nutrient quantity and quality in AP systems, thereby aecting crop yield ([Ayipio et al 2019:6512](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YDDD8GYQ?page=2))

In total, 50 eect sizes were obtained from 22 studies. ([Ayipio et al 2019:6513](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YDDD8GYQ?page=3))
