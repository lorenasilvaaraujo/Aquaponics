It is however a very good study, well executed and explained. ([note on p.124064)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=1)

Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grafted to salinity tolerant wild tomatoes ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124064](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=1))

The experimental period lasted 175 days. ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124064](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=1))

Tomato was cultivated during 20 weeks in a net house (80% mesh cover) ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124065](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=2))

The control was one hydroponic non-grafted treatment ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124065](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=2))

he total experiment lasted 25 weeks, including plant production and grafting (Week 0e5), biofilters nitrification (Weeks 5e9), and ending with shrimp growth (Weeks 9e25) and tomato production (Weeks 6e25) ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124065](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=2))

The four-levels factors were ecotype (three wild tomatoes plus the hybrid [Canek F1]) and the salinity factor (2, 4, 6, and 9 g/L), ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124066](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=3))

Sulfuric acid (H2SO4 at 1 meq/L) was added to adjust the pH to 6 for each treatment. ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124066](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=3))

The nitrogen cycle was considered established following Somerville et al. (2014): "when the NO3 level is steadily increasing" ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124066](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=3))

The TAN (mg/L), NO2 (mg/L), NO3 (mg/L), phosphate (mg/L), alkalinity (mg/L of CaCO3), and total suspended solids (TSS; mg/L) were determined weekly following the methods described by Strikland and Parsons (1972) and APHA (1998). ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124067](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=4))

Foliar total nitrogen concentration (TN, %) was measured using the ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124067](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=4))

Foliar total nitrogen concentration (TN, %) was measured using the micro-Kjeldahl method ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124067](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=4))

Phosphorus (%) was determined using the vanadate-molybdate method ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124067](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=4))

Based on collectedfield data (Papendiek et al., 2016), the IAAS and hydroponic systems were compared using a CBA (Haputta et al., 2020). ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124067](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=4))

Normality and homoscedasticity were evaluated using the Anderson-Darling and Levene's tests, respectively. ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124068](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=5))

his genotype with better tolerance was selected to be used as the standard; mortality was only 8% in 6 and 9 g/L salinity (EC¼ 11.5± 0.22 and 16.1± 0.32 dS/m), over 4 weeks (Fig. 2) ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124068](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=5))

highest production (77.46 t/ha) corresponded to the treatment irrigated with the SNS control treatment, without statistical differences at 2 g/L salinity. For the 4 and 6 g/L salinities, production was reduced by 40 and 54%, respectively, without significant differences (Fig. 5). ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124068](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=5))

[[Important]] Performance and production are the main parameters that describe the efficacy of an integrated aquaponics culture system in terms of optimizing water and fertilizer while simultaneously producing animals and plants at reduced socio-economic and ecological cost. ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124069](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=6))

Grafted tomato plants can reduce abiotic saline stress (Al-Harbi et al., 2017), ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124069](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=6))

he advantage was a continuous cycle without exchange to purify the shrimp rearing water, populations of bacteria in the biofilter did not "crash off", and there were no significant or sudden changes in the pH, levels of TAN, NO2, or NO3, avoiding massive shrimp mortality ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124073](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=10))

In our study, 4 g/ L salinity was found adequate for future studies focused on enhancing productivity using wild species and local vegetal resources. ([Armenta-Bojórquez et al 2021:124073](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=10))
