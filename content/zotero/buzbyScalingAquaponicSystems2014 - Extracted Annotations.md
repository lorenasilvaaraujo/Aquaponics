These results demonstrated that both crop and cropping method have considerable impacts on nutrient removal. ([Buzby and Lin 2014:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HMPZPQ85?page=1))

Despite this, it is estimated that between 30 and 65% of feed N and up to 40% of feed P is excreted (Schneider et al., 2005). ([Buzby and Lin 2014:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HMPZPQ85?page=1))

Two experiments were conducted to explore the capabilities of the method. The first examined the removal capabilities of two cultivars (lettuce (Latuca sativa 'Red Sails') and nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus 'Whirlibird Mix')) and the second examined the nutrient removal ability of lettuce over the entire cropping period ([Buzby and Lin 2014:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HMPZPQ85?page=2))

Plant biomass was quantified after the nutrient removal experiment was completed. ([Buzby and Lin 2014:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HMPZPQ85?page=2))

Water samples were analyzed according to methods delineated by APHA (1995) for TAN (Standard Method 4500-NH3 F. Phenate method), nitrate-N (4500-NO3 âˆ’ F. Cadmium reduction method), and phosphate-P (4500-P E. Ascorbic acid method). ([Buzby and Lin 2014:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HMPZPQ85?page=2))

Neither nasturtium nor lettuce was as effective at phosphate removal. ([Buzby and Lin 2014:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HMPZPQ85?page=3))
