For a one-month cultivation period, tilapia and six vegetables produced in the aquaponic system had almost twice the total value of the vegetables from the hydroponic system. ([Chen et al 2020:122888](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=1))

Thefish tank was stocked with 6.4 kg (stocking density: 18.3 kg/ m3) Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), ([Chen et al 2020:122889](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=2))

ix plant species were grown in the plant growth bed, including Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L.), kale (Brassica oleracea L.), mustard green (Brassica juncea L.), cilantro (Coriandrum sativum L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), and arugula (Eruca vesicaria L.). ([Chen et al 2020:122889](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=2))

After the third true leaf of seedlings emerged, uniform healthy seedlings were randomly chosen and transplanted into mesh pots (diameter: 7.6 cm, height: 6.4 cm) each containing 85 g of clay pebbles, then transferred to each system. The photoperiod was 14 h (8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.) consisting of natural daylight with supplemental lighting using high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps (1000 W, PARsource GROW LIGHT, Petaluma, CA, USA). The day (8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and night (10:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.) temperatures were set at 24 and 18 C, respectively. Depending on the ambient temperature, the greenhouse was heated using radiant hot-water-pipe heating when needed. Furthermore, retractable shade curtains regulated by an environ- ([Chen et al 2020:122889](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=2))

measured daily ([Chen et al 2020:122889](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=2))

fresh weight of the shoot was determined immediately using an analytical balance. ([Chen et al 2020:122889](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=2))

instead of physical functional unit (FU), e.g., mass and volume, which is commonly used in LCA studies, we considered the difference in product price by applying a monetary FU here for an economicbased comparison, which was defined as 1 US dollar ([Chen et al 2020:122890](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=3))

The total yields of vegetables in the aquaponic and hydroponic systems were similar (4128 vs. 3872 g/1.5 m 2 /month), ([Chen et al 2020:122890](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=3))

The tilapia had a comparable FCR of 1.2 ([Chen et al 2020:122890](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=3))

Energy consumption has been identified as a major challenge for the sustainability of aquaponics regardless of facility scale ([Chen et al 2020:122892](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=5))

Fish feed production was the second major contributor ([Chen et al 2020:122892](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=5))

Due to the temperate climate region and winter season, electricity use for operations of greenhouse and both systems was the environmental hotspot, in terms of AD, GWP, AP, and EP. However, the source of energy played an important role, replacing fossil fuel by renewable energy could make hydroponics a more sustainable system. Furthermore,fish feed production was the second major contributor to the environmental impacts, except EP in which discharge of nutrient solution from aquaponics played an important role ([Chen et al 2020:122896](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYQX47WX?page=9))
