Carolina cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and Parris Island lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The aquatic organism employed was tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Nine systems were utilized with the aquaponic technique, and the remaining three were utilized with only the hydroponic technique as controls in plant production. ([Castillo-Castellanos et al 2016:637](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRWX5YY7?page=1))

A greenhouse (130 m2 in area, 8.10 9 16 m) was built (Fig. 1). ([Castillo-Castellanos et al 2016:639](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRWX5YY7?page=3))

The system used in hydroponics was operated on the same way aquaponic systems except that the clarifier and biofilter did not contain anything inside, only the water flowed there ([Castillo-Castellanos et al 2016:641](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRWX5YY7?page=5))

The system used in hydroponics was operated on the same way aquaponic systems except that the clarifier and biofilter did not contain anything inside, only the water flowed there. The systems used were randomized in the greenhouse. In hydroponic technique, we poured Steiner universal nutrient solution (1984) in the 1-m-3 tanks.

Tilapia survival was 97.2 ± 2.4 % in the total experiment after 7 weeks. Final weight (FW) was 242.9 ± 8.9 g fish-1, and specific growth (SG) and food conversion ratio (FCR) were 4.95 and 0.99, respectively ([Castillo-Castellanos et al 2016:642](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRWX5YY7?page=6))

average lettuce weight of 18.8 g ([Castillo-Castellanos et al 2016:644](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRWX5YY7?page=8))

123.2 g plant-1 ([Castillo-Castellanos et al 2016:644](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRWX5YY7?page=8))

In cucumber fruits, there were no significant differences in length, width, and weight ([Castillo-Castellanos et al 2016:644](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRWX5YY7?page=8))

We noted that the major differences between the performance of aquaponic and hydroponic systems were found in lettuce ([Castillo-Castellanos et al 2016:645](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRWX5YY7?page=9))

- [ ] Bugarı ́n-Montoya et al. (2011) reported that leafy vegetables such as lettuce have higher and steadier absorption of nitrogen during its production cycle, while in fruit plants such as cucumber and tomato, this is lower.
