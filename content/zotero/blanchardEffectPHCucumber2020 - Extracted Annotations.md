tilapia culture tanks at four pH treatments: 5.0, 5.8, 6.5, and 7.0, used to irrigate a cucumber crop ([Blanchard et al 2020:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=1))

Cucumber production pH is managed at 5.5-6.5, ([Blanchard et al 2020:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=2))

Dutch buckets (Crop King Inc., Lodi, OH, USA) containing 100% perlite media ([Blanchard et al 2020:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=2))

in the greenhouse. ([Blanchard et al 2020:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=2))

Yield was calculated as a sum of marketable fruit at the end of a 60-day cycle length. ([Blanchard et al 2020:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=3))

9.5% increase in growth rate compared to the 5.0 treatment ([Blanchard et al 2020:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=4))

A target pH of 7.0 resulted in a 9.5% increase in growth rate compared to the 5.0 treatment i ([Blanchard et al 2020:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=4))

z Target pH based on conventional recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) (7.0), conventional agriculture (6.5), conventional hydroponics (5.8) and below plantand fish recommendation (5.0). ([Blanchard et al 2020:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=4))

Nitrates in the summer 2019 trial showed a general trend of increasing concentration with increasing pH (Tables 2 and 4), which supports the trend observed by Zou [17]. ([Blanchard et al 2020:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=8))

pH has been shown to have an eect on phosphorus availability in solution [18]; however, this trend was not observed in this study, potentially due to the inability of the acid injection to reach the target pH. ([Blanchard et al 2020:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=8))

Certain nutrients are aected by the pH of nutrient solution either by influencing the ionic form of the nutrient in solution or by influencing the nutrient's uptake and assimilation into plant tissue. However, in the current study we observed no consistent increase in nutrient availability or uptake that would necessitate the use of pH adjustment in a decoupled aquaponic system. Furthermore, the observed eects of pH did not translate to an increase in yield at the pH range observed in this study ([Blanchard et al 2020:19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NQ4FKUES?page=10))
