{"/":{"title":"Aquaponics","content":"\n|![Aquaponics.dev logo](aquaponics.png)\u003cimg width=300/\u003e|Hi! My name is **Lorena**. Welcome to my digital garden. I am a PhD candidate at [Wageningen](https://www.wur.nl/en/about-wur.htm) working on making a tool to calculate the Return of Investment of Aquaponics endeavors. To do this, a lot of research material has to be read and digested. From fish, to micro-organisms, to plants, passing through finance and modelling.| \n|--------------|:-----:|\n\n\n\n\u003e [!tip] What is the purpose for this website? 🐟💦🍃🌱\n\u003e\n\u003eThis page is intended to share my notes on aquaponics and its adjacent subjects (which are a lot!). Do not expect a perfect order but a review of my takes on each article I digest, the classifications I deem important for my reasearch and my personal take on the article itself.     !\n\nEven before I started my PhD I have been researching a lot about aquaponics and adjacent topics, I have ingested over a thousand articles, papers, books and videos. It is always hard to find what you want to find, either because it is bad quality, or it is not open access or even because there is just too much mess. When my reading started getting too messy I figured I needed a system to organize it and came across the concept of digital garden, personal knowledge management (PKM), zettelkasten, Zotero and Obsidian. With this in mind, I started cataloguing my notes and wondered how many other people have done the same, searched for specific literature related to specific topics. I figured I should put it out there so other people can start from a step above what I started. \n## More Info\n \nIf you´d like to see more about me you can go visit my personal website [LorenaSA.com](https://lorenasa.com).

The advances in desalination technologies clearly show that desalinated water can be used as a substitute for freshwater to be used as potable water. A breakthrough in reverse osmosis costs has been reached, particularly in decreasing energy consumption. The introduction of nanotechnology in the membrane manufacture has resulted in reducing the volume of rejected brine which in turn alleviates the brine disposal issue. Several recent studies show that desalinated water for development of isolated areas is economically competitive to transportation of freshwater by pipeline. The introduction of solar energy to power desalination process has given a new dimension to the expansion of desalination technology. Several studies show the importance of solar desalination in countries suffering from freshwater shortage, particularly in isolated areas. This chapter presents an overview of desalination technologies with emphasis on solar energy-driven units. Some case studies are highlighted. The chapter concludes with a discussion of future avenues in solar desalination.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_4HMS53IZ)\n* [Cloud

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.603133626Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik). Be sure to configure your TLS certificates too!\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.603133626Z","tags":null},"/notes/editing":{"title":"Editing Content in Quartz","content":"\n## Editing \nQuartz runs on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so all notes are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet. This is *highly recommended* but not required.\n\n\u003e 👀 Step 4: [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview%20changes.md)\n\nFor those who like to live life more on the edge, viewing the garden through Obsidian gets you pretty close to the real thing.\n\n## Publishing Changes\nNow that you know the basics of managing your digital garden using Quartz, you can publish it to the internet!\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n\nHaving problems?

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.\n\n### New Vault\nIf you don't have an existing Vault, [download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and create a new Vault in the `/content` folder that you created and cloned during the [setup](notes/setup.md) step.\n\n### Linking an existing Vault\nThe easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of your files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the `/content` folder.\n\n## Settings\nGreat, now that you have your Obsidian linked to your Quartz, let's fix some settings so that they play well.\n\n1. Under Options \u003e Files and Links, set the New link format to always use Absolute Path in Vault.\n2.

Luckily, Obsidian supports templates which makes inserting new content really easily.\n\n**If you decide to overwrite the `/content` folder completely, don't remove the `/content/templates` folder!**\n\nHead over to Options \u003e Core Plugins and enable the Templates plugin. Then go to Options \u003e Hotkeys and set a hotkey for 'Insert Template' (I recommend `[cmd]+T`). That way, when you create a new note, you can just press the hotkey for a new template and be ready to go!\n\n\u003e 👀 Step 4: [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview%20changes.md)","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/notes/philosophy":{"title":"Quartz Philosophy","content":"\n\u003e “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming\n\n## Why Quartz?\nHosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have Docker installed already, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nNow that you are happy with how your Quartz instance looks, let's get it hosted!\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.

Over the past couple of decades, food production at a commercial scale in non-traditional food production environments have been emerging. Among other agricultural systems, the opportunities aquaponics systems present are becoming more apparent. Nonetheless, aquaponics' ability to bring together hydroponics and aquaculture to produce nutritious food has prompted more attention in terms of its economic viability and sustainability. In this paper, we present the reasons why aquaponics might be part of the solution in arid countries with particular focus on the State of Qatar.\n\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[abusinSustainableFoodProduction2020 - Annotations (12132022, 54113 PM)]]\n\n## My notes\n\n-\n\n## Zotero links\n\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_9GWBQ4UH)","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/abusinSustainableFoodProduction2020-Annotations-12132022-54113-PM":{"title":"","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[abusinSustainableFoodProduction2020]]\n\n# Annotations  \n\n# Annotations  \n(12/13/2022, 5:41:13 PM)\n\n\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F5448669%2Fitems%2F9GWBQ4UH%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\"\u003e(\u003cspan class=\"citation-item\"\u003eAbusin and Mandikiana, 2020, p. 1\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e \u003cbr\u003e  \n[[Aquaponics]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n[[Meta/Region/Qatar]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n  \n\u003ePaper only joins information from many places.

These authors obtained 2.71 kg m-2 after 21 days from transplant using 'Roman' lettuce (20 plants m-2) grown on floating root and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in high density with 8 kg fish m-3. Lennard and Leonard (2006) harvested 4.47±0.12 kg m-2 of 'Oak' leaf lettuce (40 plants m-2) in root floating technique using waste of 5 kg of Murray cod m-3. Similarly, Licamele (2009) obtained yields of 4.7 kg m-2 in 'Rex' lettuce (32 plants m-2) after 35 days with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) with a density of 5 kg fish m-3. The highest yield described in these studies could be due to Nile tilapia and Murray cod being maintained at 20 to 25°C, the optimal range for these fish and also for nitrifying bacteria and lettuce growth (FAO, 2014). ([Alcarraz et al 2018:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=3))\n\nThe nitrate concentration in lettuce cultivated in our aquaponics system was greater than the results obtained by Blidariu et al. (2013). These authors found 810 mg kg-1 fw in Spanish lettuce cultivated with residues of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca). The nitrate concentration (1087.2±458.1 mg kg-1 fw) in our hydroponic lettuce was higher than the data reported by Lastra et al. (2009) for the cultivars 'Grand Rapids', 'Breeze', 'Divine' and 'Prima'. The higher nitrates concentration found in hydroponic lettuce in the present study could be explained due to the greater availability of nitrate in the nutrient solution at the beginning of the experiment (150 mg L-1). While for the lettuce in the aquaponic system the average concentration of nitrate was 14.9 mg L-1.

Scuderi et al. (2011) reported counts of 6.0 log CFU g-1 for lettuce grown in a hydroponic floating root system. Enterobacteriaceae count was less than 2.3 log CFU g-1 reported by Scuderi et al. (2011) in a similar study. The psychrophilic bacteria count was lower than the value reported by Orellana (2011), who found 4.9 log CFU g-1 in rocket leaves grown in hydroponic system. According to Selma et al. (2012), psychrophilic bacteria can quickly decrease the quality of refrigerated products like vegetables. Low microbial counts in leaves were found in all harvest times according to the Chilean legislation, probably due to drinking water was used in the experiments (Hollyer et al., 2009; MINSAL, 2014).

Water consumption as well as the environmental impact in this type of system are lower compared to more traditional hydroponic and aquaculture counterparts, due to its dual productive nature and closed condition of the system allowing the reuse of water and fish waste. The present study evaluated the yield, nitrate concentration, microbiological and functional quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in two production systems: aquaponics and hydroponics. At the same time, fresh mass gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were assessed. Lettuces were grown in an aquaponic system using waste water from the fish system, as well as in a hydroponic system with nutrient solution (Hoagland II-modified) both for 21 days. At the end of this period, baby lettuce (8 and 12 cm of length) was harvested. The yield of lettuce grown in aquaponic system was 6.73% higher than that of grown in hydroponic system. Also aquaponically grown lettuce had lower nitrate concentration (1079 mg kg-1 FW) than hydroponically grown lettuce (1229 mg kg-1 FW). Lettuces grown in both systems showed no significant differences in the microbial and functional qualities. Rainbow trout in the aquaponic system increased 13.6 g over 27.1±0.8 g initial fresh weight, obtaining a FCR of 0.74 after the experiment. These results indicate that the aquaponic system used in the present study is a sustainable alternative for the production of high quality lettuce considering its high yield, lower concentration of nitrates and similar microbiological and functional qualities compared to hydroponic systems, while allowing simultaneous fish farming with a good feed conversion ratio (74 g of food was needed to produce 100 g of rainbow trout).\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_2J8AIQBB)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/2J8AIQBB)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[alcarrazQualityLettuceLactuca2018 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021":{"title":"","content":"# Pacific white shrimp and tomato production using water effluents and salinity-tolerant grafted plants in an integrated aquaponic production system\n\n![[armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021-zotero#Metadata]]\n\nOther files:\n* Mdnotes File Name: [[armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021]]\n* Metadata File Name: [[armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021-zotero]]\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_AJLUXAWU)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/AJLUXAWU)\n\n## Notes\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021-Extracted-Annotations":{"title":"","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021]]\n\n# Extracted Annotations\n\n**Extracted Annotations**\n\n\u003e [[lorena]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[aquaponics]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Meta/Region/Mexico]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Fish/Species/Pacific White Shrimp]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Tomato]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Experiment]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Yield]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Salinity]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[graft]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e   \n\u003e \u003eGrafting tomatoes with wild salinity resistant tomatoes can be done in an intermediate salinity level (suboptimal for both tomatoes and shrimp).

Integrated agri-aquaculture systems (IAAS) offer a number of advantages for sustainable agriculture, including water reutilization, discharge mitigation, and increased proﬁtability by leveraging the symbiotic relationship between organic waste, bacterial mineralization, and plant ﬁltration. The aim of this study was to assess the production of two food items of global socio-economic importance cultivated at different salinities: Paciﬁc white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grafted to salinity tolerant wild tomatoes. Paciﬁc white shrimp were cultured at a density of 125 organisms/m3 and tomatoes at a density of 3 plants/m. The shrimp growth test consisted of three salinity levels: 2, 4, and 6 g/L. The corresponding tomato salinity treatments were conducted using shrimp water efﬂuents; Steiner’s universal nutrient solution (SNS) was used for the control treatment. The experimental period lasted 175 days. The highest tomato production (77.46 t/ha) was attained with SNS, with no signiﬁcant difference from the salinity of 2 g/L. Shrimp ﬁnal mean weight, survival, and production were higher at the 6 g/L salinity; and all the other zootechnical parameters decreased with lower salinity. When compared with the hydroponic system using a cost-beneﬁt analysis (CBA), the production costs associated with the IAAS were lower primarily because of the reduced (or null) costs of fertilizer, and irrigation water. When grafted plants were used, the salinity tolerance of the commercial hybrid increased and shrimp could be cultured at appropriate salinity to facilitate osmoregulation. Chemical fertilization requirements were reduced and acceptable yields were obtained for the tomato crop by grafting to salinity-tolerant rootstocks.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_AJLUXAWU)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/AJLUXAWU)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/ayipioComparisonsAquaponicConventional2019":{"title":"","content":"# Comparisons between Aquaponic and Conventional Hydroponic Crop Yields: A Meta-Analysis\n\n![[ayipioComparisonsAquaponicConventional2019-zotero#Metadata]]\n\nOther files:\n* Mdnotes File Name: [[ayipioComparisonsAquaponicConventional2019]]\n* Metadata File Name: [[ayipioComparisonsAquaponicConventional2019-zotero]]\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_UKVSXXL6)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/UKVSXXL6)\n\n## Notes\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/ayipioComparisonsAquaponicConventional2019-Extracted-Annotations":{"title":"","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[ayipioComparisonsAquaponicConventional2019]]\n\n# Extracted Annotations\n\n**Extracted Annotations**\n\n\u003e [[lorena]]  \n\u003e [[Aquaponics]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Meta/Region/USA]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Meta-Analysis]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e   \n\u003e \u003eShows relationship between some factors and yields.

However, there is no consensus on comparability between crop yields obtained from aquaponics (AP) and conventional hydroponics (cHP). Meta-analysis was used to synthesize the literature on studies that compared crop yields of AP and cHP. Factors responsible for diﬀerences were also examined through subgroup analysis. A literature search was conducted in ﬁve databases with no time restriction in order to capture any publication on AP and cHP crop yield comparisons. The search was, however, limited to journal and conference articles published in English. Study characteristics and outcome measures of food crops were extracted. A natural log response ratio eﬀect size measure was used to transform study outcomes. An unweighted meta-analysis was conducted through bootstrapping to calculate overall eﬀect size and its conﬁdence interval. Between-study heterogeneity (I2) was estimated using a random eﬀects model. Subgroup and meta-regression were used to assess moderators, in an attempt to explain heterogeneity in the eﬀect size. The results showed that although crop yield in AP was lower than conventional cHP, the diﬀerence was not statistically signiﬁcant. However, drawing conclusions on the overall eﬀect size must be done with caution due to the use of unweighted meta-analysis. There were statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects of aquatic organism, hydroponic system type, and nutrient supplementation used in the studies on crop yield comparisons. Nutrient supplementation, particularly, led to on average higher crop yield in AP relative to cHP. These ﬁndings are a vital information source for choosing factors to include in an AP study. These ﬁndings also synthesize the current trends in AP crop yields in comparison with cHP.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_UKVSXXL6)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/UKVSXXL6)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[ayipioComparisonsAquaponicConventional2019 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020":{"title":"","content":"# Effects of stocking density on the growth and flesh quality of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reared in a low-tech aquaponic system\n\n![[biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020-zotero#Metadata]]\n\nOther files:\n* Mdnotes File Name: [[biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020]]\n* Metadata File Name: [[biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020-zotero]]\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_FZLVNZLG)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/FZLVNZLG)\n\n## Notes\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020-Extracted-Annotations":{"title":"","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020]]\n\n# Extracted Annotations\n\n**Extracted Annotations**\n\nlettuce ([Birolo et al 2020:735653](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=1))\n\nrainbow trout ([Birolo et al 2020:735653](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=1))\n\n117 day trial p ([Birolo et al 2020:735653](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG?page=1))\n\n\u003e [[lorena]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Aquaponics]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Meta/Region/Italy]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Lettuce]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Fish/Species/Rainbow Trout]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Experiment]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Yield]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Nitrate]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Microbial counts]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[FCR]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Stocking Density]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e   \n\u003e \u003eTests different stocking densities and concludes that differences does not affect fish growth or flesh quality.

Nine experimental units (three replications per treatment) were utilised. A total of 123 rainbow trout (initial body weight: 142 ± 35 g) were randomly distributed in six 500-L tanks (3 per stocking density) and monitored during a 117 day trial period. The ﬁnal weight (331 g on average), speciﬁc growth rate (0.73% d−1), feed conversion ratio (1.58), and mortality (3%) of the ﬁsh did not diﬀer between stocking densities. The morphometric indices, slaughter results, and ﬂesh quality were not aﬀected. Similarly, the quantity of lettuce produced during two consecutive cycles was similar among treatments (2.4 kg m−2 on average). At harvest, microbial contamination (total viable count, E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, mould, and yeasts) was similar in the ﬁsh skin and lettuce produced in aquaponic systems with diﬀerent stocking densities, as well as in the lettuce produced in aquaponic and hydroponic systems. In conclusion, rainbow trout and lettuce productions were successful in the tested aquaponic system, whereas stocking density did not aﬀect ﬁsh growth or ﬂesh quality.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_FZLVNZLG)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/FZLVNZLG)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/blanchardEffectPHCucumber2020":{"title":"","content":"# Effect of pH on Cucumber Growth and Nutrient Availability in a Decoupled Aquaponic System with Minimal Solids Removal\n\n![[blanchardEffectPHCucumber2020-zotero#Metadata]]\n\nOther files:\n* Mdnotes File Name: [[blanchardEffectPHCucumber2020]]\n* Metadata File Name: [[blanchardEffectPHCucumber2020-zotero]]\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_T5JKLQWN)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/T5JKLQWN)\n\n## Notes\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/blanchardEffectPHCucumber2020-Extracted-Annotations":{"title":"","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[blanchardEffectPHCucumber2020]]\n\n# Extracted Annotations\n\n**Extracted Annotations**\n\n\u003e [[lorena]] [[Aquaponics]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Meta/Region/USA]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Cucumber]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Fish/Species/Tilapia]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Experiment]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Yield]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Nitrate]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Microbial counts]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[FCR]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[pH]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Decoupled]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e   \n\u003e \u003eNo relevant effects were shown when changing the pH.

Aquaponic systems are known to be deﬁcient in several plant-essential elements, which can be aﬀected by solution pH to either increase or decrease available nutrients. To determine the eﬀect of pH in a decoupled aquaponic system, a study was conducted using aquaculture eﬄuent from tilapia culture tanks at four pH treatments: 5.0, 5.8, 6.5, and 7.0, used to irrigate a cucumber crop. Growth and yield parameters, nutrient content of the irrigation water, and nutrients incorporated into the plant tissue were collected over two growing seasons. pH did not have a practical eﬀect on growth rate, internode length or yield over the two growing seasons. Availability and uptake of several nutrients were aﬀected by pH, but there was no overarching eﬀect that would necessitate its use in commercial systems. Nutrient concentrations in the aquaculture eﬄuent would be considered low compared to hydroponic solutions; however, elemental analysis of leaf tissues was within the recommended ranges. Research into other nutrient sources provided by the system (i.e., solid particles carried with the irrigation water) would provide further information into the nutrient dynamics of this system.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_T5JKLQWN)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/T5JKLQWN)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[blanchardEffectPHCucumber2020 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014":{"title":"","content":"# Scaling aquaponic systems: Balancing plant uptake with fish output\n\n![[buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014-zotero#Metadata]]\n\nOther files:\n* Mdnotes File Name: [[buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014]]\n* Metadata File Name: [[buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014-zotero]]\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_PQ7NSFW9)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/PQ7NSFW9)\n\n## Notes\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014-Extracted-Annotations":{"title":"","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014]]\n\n# Extracted Annotations\n\n**Extracted Annotations**\n\n\u003e [[lorena]] [[Aquaponics]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Meta/Region/USA]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Lettuce]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Nasturtium]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Fish/Species/Tilapia]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Experiment]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant age]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Yield]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Nitrate]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Phosphate]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[pH]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Decoupled]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e   \n\u003e \u003eFocused on nutrient removal (Phosphate and Nitrates).

We describe a method where the plant component was isolated from the fish rearing operation so that nutrient removal could be evaluated independently. Two crops, lettuce (Latuca sativa) and nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus), were evaluated. Nasturtium had higher removal rates and removed both total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrate resulting in 80% DIN removal while lettuce removed only 48%. Lettuce removed only TAN and was ineffective at nitrate removal. Older plants were more effective at DIN removal while younger plants were more effective at PO4removal. When normalized for biomass, younger plants had much higher removal rates. These results demonstrated that both crop and cropping method have considerable impacts on nutrient removal. This method will allow operators to adjust their system quickly and easily to meet remediation goals.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_PQ7NSFW9)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/PQ7NSFW9)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016":{"title":"","content":"# Implementation of an experimental nutrient film technique-type aquaponic system\n\n![[castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016-zotero#Metadata]]\n\nOther files:\n* Mdnotes File Name: [[castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016]]\n* Metadata File Name: [[castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016-zotero]]\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_3PNWV7N2)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/3PNWV7N2)\n\n## Notes\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016-Extracted-Annotations":{"title":"","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016]]\n\n# Extracted Annotations\n\n**Extracted Annotations**\n\n\u003e [[lorena]] [[Aquaponics]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Meta/Region/Mexico]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Lettuce]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Cucumber]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Fish/Species/Tilapia]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Experiment]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Yield]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[FCR]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Survival rate]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Greenhouse]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Hydroponics]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e   \n\u003e \u003eExperiment that uses Hydroponics as control.

The essential elements of an aquaponic system consist of the following ﬁve: a tank to maintain aquatic organisms; a clariﬁer or sedimentation; a bioﬁlter; a hydroponic component; and a sump pump. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of a nutrient ﬁlm technique-type aquaponic system, which does not include the sump pump. Aquaponic systems were tested during one production cycle of the Carolina cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and Parris Island lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The aquatic organism employed was tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Nine systems were utilized with the aquaponic technique, and the remaining three were utilized with only the hydroponic technique as controls in plant production. The proposed aquaponic system worked efﬁciently during the entire crop cycle without any problems or deﬁciencies from lack sump. No changes were made in the ﬂow of water in the aquaponic system during the growing season. Tilapia survival was 97.2 ± 2.4 %. Speciﬁc growth and food conversion ratios were 4.95 and 0.99, respectively. In plant survival, there were no signiﬁcant differences (p [ 0.05) between both production techniques. In lettuce, foliar wet weight, foliar dry weight, and yield were higher (p \\ 0.05) in hydroponics. In cucumber, fruit number and yield were higher (p \\ 0.05) in the hydroponic system. Fruit length, width, and weight exhibited no differences (p [ 0.05).\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_3PNWV7N2)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/3PNWV7N2)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/ceroziFulvicAcidIncreases2020":{"title":"","content":"# Fulvic acid increases iron bioavailability in aquaponic systems: Theoretical designs and practical considerations to prevent iron deficiency in plants\n\n![[ceroziFulvicAcidIncreases2020-zotero#Metadata]]\n\nOther files:\n* Mdnotes File Name: [[ceroziFulvicAcidIncreases2020]]\n* Metadata File Name: [[ceroziFulvicAcidIncreases2020-zotero]]\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_XSD8SV27)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/XSD8SV27)\n\n## Notes\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/ceroziFulvicAcidIncreases2020-Extracted-Annotations":{"title":"Aquaponics2","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[ceroziFulvicAcidIncreases2020]]\n\n# Extracted Annotations\n\n**Extracted Annotations**\n\nIron is generally supplemented in the form of synthetic iron chelates (Fe-EDTA, Fe-DTPA or Fe-EDDHA); however, little attention has been paid to exactly why this supplementation is necessary for aquaponics operations (Bartelme et al., 2018).

However, the solid waste excreted by ﬁsh contains considerable amounts iron, which are lost in the system by precipitation of insoluble iron oxides. Thus, the present study proposed the use of fulvic acid (FA), a humic substance with metal complexing capacity, to prevent iron precipitation and enhance its bioavailability in the aquaculture wastewater. An aquaponic solution was added with levels of fulvic acid (0, 69, 138, 345, and 690 mg L−1), and analyzed for dissolved iron after incubation and centrifugation. Visual MINTEQ was used to characterize and quantify the eﬀect of fulvic acid levels on iron precipitation, species of possible solid forms, and concentration of dissolved bioavailable iron forms. Dissolved iron concentration increased with the inclusion of fulvic acid in the nutrient solution, and the highest iron concentration (22.4 μM) was obtained by treating the solution with 690 mg L−1 of fulvic acid. Visual MINTEQ simulations demonstrated that, in the absence of fulvic acid, iron precipitated in the form of αFe2O3, and the concentration of available iron increased with the inclusion of FA due to its complexing properties. Solution pH had no eﬀect on iron availability with the absence of fulvic acid; in its presence, the eﬀect of pH was only signiﬁcant at values below 4.5. This study shows that fulvic acid seems to play an important role in transporting low-soluble iron from ﬁsh tanks to plant roots in aquaponic systems.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_XSD8SV27)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/XSD8SV27)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[ceroziFulvicAcidIncreases2020 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/chenComparativeLifeCycle2020":{"title":"","content":"# Comparative life cycle assessment of aquaponics and hydroponics in the Midwestern United States\n\n![[chenComparativeLifeCycle2020-zotero#Metadata]]\n\nOther files:\n* Mdnotes File Name: [[chenComparativeLifeCycle2020]]\n* Metadata File Name: [[chenComparativeLifeCycle2020-zotero]]\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_LDXLBEAP)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/LDXLBEAP)\n\n## Notes\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/chenComparativeLifeCycle2020-Extracted-Annotations":{"title":"","content":"* Mdnotes File Name: [[chenComparativeLifeCycle2020]]\n\n# Extracted Annotations\n\n**Extracted Annotations**\n\n\u003e [[lorena]] [[Aquaponics]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Meta/Region/USA]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Swiss Chardl]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Kale]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Mustard Green]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Cilantro]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Lettuce]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant/Species/Arugula]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Plant density]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[FCR]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Fish/Species/Tilapia]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Fish density]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Experiment]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Yield]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[Greenhouse]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [[LCA]]  \n\u003e   \n\u003e   \n\u003e \u003eLCA analysis between hydroponics and aquaponics in a greenhouse - electricity has the highest impact followed by fish feed (depends on energy source and climate).

However, both aquaponic and hydroponic systems require high energy input, leading to potential environmental burdens. This cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA), for the ﬁrst time, compared the environmental performance, on an economic basis, of aquaponics and hydroponics with identical system design in Indiana, US. For a one-month cultivation period, tilapia and six vegetables produced in the aquaponic system had almost twice the total value of the vegetables from the hydroponic system. Aquaponics produced 45% lower endpoint environmental impact than hydroponics. Electricity use for greenhouse heating and lighting, and water pumping and heating contributed to the majority of the environmental impacts of both systems, which was followed by the production of ﬁsh feed and fertilizers. However, changing the energy source from coal to wind power could make the hydroponic system more environment-friendly than the aquaponic system.

RAS wastewater is complemented with macroand micronutrients to obtain equivalent concentrations and pH as in standard hydroponic nutrient solutions (NS). Unlike in single recirculating aquaponic systems, optimal growth conditions can be established in each production part of a DAPS (i.e. ﬁsh and plant parts) avoiding compromises. DAPS design seems more adapted for commercial farming operations but feasibility studies on large-scale systems are lacking. Therefore, the production of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L., cv.

The comparison between aquaponics and hydroponics has attracted considerable attention recently, particularly regarding plant yield. However, previous research has not focused on the potential of using aquaponic solution complemented with mineral elements to commercial hydroponic levels in order to increase yield. For this purpose, lettuce plants were put into AeroFlo installations and exposed to hydroponic (HP), aquaponic (AP), or complemented aquaponic (CAP) solutions. The principal ﬁnding of this research was that AP and HP treatments exhibited similar (p \u003e 0.05) plant growth, whereas the shoot weight of the CAP treatment showed a signiﬁcant (p \u003c 0.05) growth rate increase of 39% on average compared to the HP and AP treatments. Additionally, the root weight was similar (p \u003e 0.05) in AP and CAP treatments, and both were signiﬁcantly higher (p \u003c 0.05) than that observed in the HP treatment. The results highlight the beneﬁcial effect of recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) water on plant growth. The ﬁndings represent a further step toward developing decoupled aquaponic systems (i.e., two- or multi-loops) that have the potential to establish a more productive alternative to hydroponic systems. Microorganisms and dissolved organic matter are suspected to play an important role in RAS water for promoting plant roots and shoots growth.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_DBXDVSNK)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/DBXDVSNK)\n\n## Highlights and Annotations\n\n- [[delaideLettuceLactucaSativa2016 - Extracted Annotations]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/goddekNavigatingDecoupledAquaponic2016-zotero":{"title":"","content":"# Navigating towards Decoupled Aquaponic Systems: A System Dynamics Design Approach\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Simon Goddek]], [[Carlos Espinal]], [[Boris Delaide]], [[Mohamed Jijakli]], [[Zala Schmautz]], [[Sven Wuertz]], [[Karel Keesman]]\n* Date: [[2016-07-21]]\n* Date Added: [[2019-01-16]]\n* URL: [http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/7/303](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/7/303)\n* DOI: [10.3390/w8070303](https://doi.org/10.3390/w8070303)\n* Cite key: goddekNavigatingDecoupledAquaponic2016\n* Topics: [[Aquaponics]]\n* Tags: #⭕, #review, #aquaponics, #zotero, #literature-notes, #reference\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Goddek et al. - 2016 - Navigating towards Decoupled Aquaponic Systems A .pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T8H454RD)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe classical working principle of aquaponics is to provide nutrient-rich aquacultural water to a hydroponic plant culture unit, which in turn depurates the water that is returned to the aquaculture tanks. A known drawback is that a compromise away from optimal growing conditions for plants and ﬁsh must be achieved to produce both crops and ﬁsh in the same environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to develop a theoretical concept of a decoupled aquaponic system (DAPS), and predict water, nutrient (N and P), ﬁsh, sludge, and plant levels. This has been approached by developing a dynamic aquaponic system model, using inputs from data found in literature covering the ﬁelds of aquaculture, hydroponics, and sludge treatment. The outputs from the model showed the dependency of aquacultural water quality on the hydroponic evapotranspiration rate. This result can be explained by the fact that DAPS is based on one-way ﬂows. These one-way ﬂows results in accumulations of remineralized nutrients in the hydroponic component ensuring optimal conditions for the plants. The study also suggests to size the cultivation area based on P availability in the hydroponic component as P is an exhaustible resource and has been identiﬁed one of the main limiting factors for plant growth.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_SY2X3ICZ)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/SY2X3ICZ)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/kaburagiAquaponicsUsingSaline2020":{"title":"","content":"# Aquaponics using saline groundwater: Effect of adding microelements to fish wastewater on the growth of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L. spp. cicla)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Emi Kaburagi]], [[Mina Yamada]], [[Takashi Baba]], [[Hideyasu Fujiyama]], [[Bernardo Murillo-Amador]], [[Satoshi Yamada]]\n* Date: [[01/2020]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* URL: [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378377419303701](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378377419303701)\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105851](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105851)\n* Cite key: kaburagiAquaponicsUsingSaline2020\n* Topics: [[Aquaponics]]\n* Tags: #⭕, #review, #aquaponics, #zotero, #literature-notes, #reference\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Kaburagi et al. - 2020 - Aquaponics using saline groundwater Effect of add.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGHAYA2V)\n\n## Abstract\n\nSaline soil and saline groundwater reduce agricultural productivity on drylands. We are developing a new aquaponics system to improve food productivity on such lands while effectively utilizing saline groundwater. In this study, cultivation of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L. spp. cicla cv. Seiyou Shirokuki) was carried out using fish wastewater with a high salt concentration (1150 mg L−1 NaCl). The levels of microelements (e.g., Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) in the fish wastewater were very low, so we added microelements at 100% (W100), 50% (W50), 25% (W25), and 0% (W0) of the levels in the standard hydroponics solution to the fish wastewater and investigated the effects on growth of Swiss chard. At the first harvest, yields in all wastewater treatments were as high or higher than in the control. At the second harvest, yields in W100, W50, and W25 were not significantly different from the control, while in W0 the yield was significantly lower and chlorosis was evident. At the third harvest, the yield in all wastewater treatments was less than in the control, and chlorosis symptoms were observed in W25 and W0. Since leaf Mn and Zn concentrations in W25 and W0 had decreased to below the critical values for those microelements, Mn and Zn deficiency might have contributed to the observed chlorosis and yield loss. For the cultivation of Swiss chard with fish wastewater, sufficient yield (i.e., comparable to or better than the control) without chlorosis was obtained when microelements were added at 50% of the level of the control solution. In addition, since sufficient yield was obtained even in W0 at the first harvest, it is suggested that longer-term cultivation and higher yield could be achieved by applying 50% microelements after the first harvest.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_BMLZLVK7)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/BMLZLVK7)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/lenzCommonChicoryProduction2021":{"title":"","content":"# Common chicory production in aquaponics and in soil fertilized with aquaponic sludge\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Guilherme Luis Lenz]], [[Arcângelo Loss]], [[Cledimar Rogério Lourenzi]], [[Diogo Luiz de Alcantara Lopes]], [[Lucas de Matos Siebeneichler]], [[Gustavo Brunetto]]\n* Date: [[04/2021]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* URL: [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304423821000534](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304423821000534)\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.scienta.2021.109946](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.109946)\n* Cite key: lenzCommonChicoryProduction2021\n* Topics: [[Aquaponics]]\n* Tags: #⭕, #review, #aquaponics, #zotero, #literature-notes, #reference\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Lenz et al. - 2021 - Common chicory production in aquaponics and in soi.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ9Z8RSY)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis study assessed the common chicory performance in aquaponics and soil fertilized with aquaponics sludge. The experimental setup consisted of an aquaponic system for farming tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and culti­ vating common chicory (Cichorium intybus), with two interdependent cultivation lines. The aquaponics component consisted of two treatments with six repetitions, comparing the two cultivation methods of (1) floating rafts and (2) substrate. The soil production of the plants consisted of three treatments with three rep­ etitions: (1) fertilization with aquaponic sludge; (2) chemical fertilization (NPK); and (3) control (without fertilization). The sludge (80 L) was collected twice weekly from the bottom of two clarifiers, homogenized, and later applied to the soil. The results of the productive performance and the composition of the plant tissue were evaluated, comparing phyto-technical parameters (NL: number of leaves; LLL: longer leaf length; FM: fresh matter; and DM: Dry matter) of each plant between treatments in the soil and between treatments in aquaponics, and a comparison between cycles for each treatment. Higher yields (g plant− 1) were obtained in the aquaponics system with the floating method when compared to the substrate method for the common chicory in the first cycle. In the second cycle, there was a higher yield of vegetables with the substrate method perhaps due to the accumulation of organic matter in the substrate. The vegetables grown in the floating method accumulated higher concentrations of N, P and K in the leaf tissues in both cycles. The production of common chicory in the soil during the first cycle showed no differences between the Sludge and NPK treatments, and both were superior to the Control for all phyto-technical parameters. Differences were shown for the LLL, FM and DM for the second cycle, with higher values shown for plants fertilized with sludge when compared to those treated with NPK or in the Control. These results suggest a cumulative effect of nutrients in the soil after successive sludge applications combined with the mineralization of nutrients, making them available in soil solution. Higher P concentrations in the leaf tissue of the common chicory in the treatment with sludge fertilization suggests higher absorption rates of this element. The aquaponic sludge can be used to fertilize vegetables in the soil and obtain yields similar to and possibly higher than those of mineral fertilization.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_CEPRLSPG)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/CEPRLSPG)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/magwazaPartiallyTreatedDomestic2020":{"title":"","content":"# Partially treated domestic wastewater as a nutrient source for tomatoes (Lycopersicum solanum) grown in a hydroponic system: effect on nutrient absorption and yield\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Shirly Tentile Magwaza]], [[Lembe Samukelo Magwaza]], [[Alfred Oduor Odindo]], [[Asanda Mditshwa]], [[Christopher Buckley]]\n* Date: [[12/2020]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* URL: [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405844020325883](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405844020325883)\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05745](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05745)\n* Cite key: magwazaPartiallyTreatedDomestic2020\n* Topics: [[Aquaponics]]\n* Tags: #⭕, #review, #aquaponics, #zotero, #literature-notes, #reference\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Magwaza et al. - 2020 - Partially treated domestic wastewater as a nutrien.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F596AVJZ)\n\n## Abstract\n\nUsing efﬂuent from the anaerobic bafﬂed reactor (ABR) of the decentralised wastewater treatment system (DEWATS) as a sole nutrient source is not sufﬁcient for tomato plants grown in hydroponic system. The study investigated the effects of commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix (CHFM) combined with ABR efﬂuent on tomato growth and yield. A media-based hydroponic technique consisting of three treatments, namely, ABR efﬂuent, CHFM, and ABR efﬂuent combined with CHFM (ABR þ CHFM (50:50 v/v) was used. The results showed that plant growth parameters, biomass, fruit yield and shoot nutrient content were signiﬁcantly higher in tomato plants fed with CHFM and ABR þ CHFM than those grown in ABR efﬂuent. Addition of 50 % dose of CHFM in ABR wastewater (ABR þ CHFM) increased shoot N, K, Ca and Zn. These results indicated that adding 50% CHFM can alleviate nutrient deﬁciencies when partially treated wastewater from anaerobic digester is used as a nutrient source for hydroponic tomato cultivation.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_9JHZ6KNW)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/9JHZ6KNW)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/reyes-yanesRealtimeGrowthRate2020":{"title":"","content":"# Real-time growth rate and fresh weight estimation for little gem romaine lettuce in aquaponic grow beds\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[A.

Aquaponics technique, on the other hand, is a farming method that combines a recirculating aquaculture system and soilless hydroponics agriculture promising to be one of the answers to sustainability in the food industry. Lack of intelligent real-time approaches to monitor and track plant growth is hindering the transition of aquaponic systems towards automation and commercialization. Computer vision can promote further contributions in smart applications in aquaponics; therefore, a methodology is pro­ posed to measure in real-time the growth rate and fresh weight of crops in multi-instance setups. The proposed system uses image-processing techniques, deep learning, and regression analysis to estimate the size of the crops as they grow using image segmentation. Then, a correlation between the size of the crops and their fresh weight is modelled. For common little gem romaine lettuce, the size of crops and fresh weight is estimated with an overall error of 30 mm (18.7%) and 0.5 g (8.3%), respectively.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_J8PCP3YR)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/J8PCP3YR)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/sangeethaEnhancedCosteffectiveTechniques2020":{"title":"","content":"# Enhanced and cost-effective techniques used for plant growth in vertical agriculture\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Tupili Sangeetha]], [[P.

Due to this, the agriculture land is decreasing that results less food production and cannot supply necessary food for the increased population. The people already experience this problem during COVID-19 pandemic. The vertical agriculture is ideal solution that introduced to ensure food security. In this form of soilless agriculture, we use controlling environment to monitor plant growth, to record pH and EC levels daily, to test for disease detections, to supply water with required nutrients and to check CO2 concentration. In this paper, we observed that plant intakes changing at various stages such as germination, vegetative, reproduction and maturity stages. We proposed enhanced and costeffective techniques for supplying all essentials of plants as much as they required according to their stage. We introduced two methods 1. To identify the vegetative stage based on plant height 2. To identify the reproduction stage using R-CNN algorithm. This helps to inform the farmer let to know the changes in plant stages in right time.\n\n\n##  Zotero links\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_JPDZGGSU)\n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/JPDZGGSU)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/saseendranEnhancedGrowthResponse2021":{"title":"# Enhanced growth response and stress mitigation of genetically improved farmed Tilapia in a biofloc integrated aquaponic system with bell pepper","content":"# Enhanced growth response and stress mitigation of genetically improved farmed Tilapia in a biofloc integrated aquaponic system with bell pepper\n\n## Zotero links\n\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_YEFHZTLY)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Sanitha Saseendran]], [[Kiran Dube]], [[M.H.

Significantly higher specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio for fish reared in T1 (2.03% day− 1 and 2.31, respectively) followed by T2 (1.79% day− 1 and 2.18, respectively).The results revealed that fishes reared in integrated system showed significantly (p \u003c 0.05) lower stress parameters especially in treatments T1 and T2 as compared to control.The present study concluded that the integration of biofloc system with aquaponics can be recommended for better production of GIFT strain of tilapia, maintaining a stocking density of 150 no.m− 3 for ideal production of bell pepper, without creating any stressful environment for fish.\n\n\n\n## My notes\n\n-","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/suSimultaneousRemovalToxic2020":{"title":"# Simultaneous removal of toxic ammonia and lettuce cultivation in aquaponic system using microwave pyrolysis biochar","content":"# Simultaneous removal of toxic ammonia and lettuce cultivation in aquaponic system using microwave pyrolysis biochar\n\n## Zotero links\n\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_JRXE6P93)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Man Huan Su]], [[Elfina Azwar]], [[YaFeng Yang]], [[Christian Sonne]], [[Peter Nai Yuh Yek]], [[Rock Keey Liew]], [[Chin Kui Cheng]], [[Pau Loke Show]], [[Su Shiung Lam]]\n* URL: [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304389420305999](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304389420305999)\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122610](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122610)\n* Cite key: suSimultaneousRemovalToxic2020\n* Topics: [[Aquaponics]]\n* Tags: #⭕, #review, #aquaponics, #zotero, #literature-notes, #reference [[0.seed]]\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Su et al. - 2020 - Simultaneous removal of toxic ammonia and lettuce .pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FDZPDCZ5)\n\ntest\n\n\n\n## My notes\n\n-","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/sundarStudyGrowthPerformance2020":{"title":"# Study on the Growth Performance of Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and Pak Choi (Brassica chinensis) in Different Aquaponic Growing Systems","content":"# Study on the Growth Performance of Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and Pak Choi (Brassica chinensis) in Different Aquaponic Growing Systems\n\n## Zotero links\n\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_IDZYFJTF)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Laurence Shiva Sundar]], [[Guangyau Stanley Chen]]\n* Cite key: sundarStudyGrowthPerformance2020\n* Topics: [[Aquaponics]]\n* Tags: #[[0.seed]], #⭕, #aquaponics, #review, #zotero, #literature-notes, #reference [[0.seed]]\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Sundar and Chen - 2020 - Study on the Growth Performance of Lettuce (Lactuc.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/265SF8WL)\n\ntest\n\n## Abstract\n\nAquaponics is a human-made recirculating ecosystem that integrates the cultivation of crops and aquaculture to produce higher-quality, safe, and nutritious food. However, limited studies have been conducted to investigate the performance of diﬀerent aquaponic plant growing systems. As such, the current research focuses on evaluating the overall performance of four diﬀerent aquaponic growing systems in the growth and yield of lettuce and pak choi. The data on the shoot and root biomass and growth parameters were collected, and the growth analysis was performed. The relative growth rate results indicated that the appropriate environmental conditions were provided for lettuce and pak choi to grow successfully in all the four aquaponic growing systems. The crop growth rate results revealed that all four aquaponic growing systems tested in this experiment were able to grow crops and provide yield successfully. However, the substrate-based closed capillary water distribution system (CCWD) had the best overall result, which showed great potential for aquaponic applications to promote alternative agriculture production under unfavored climate conditions.\n\n\n\n## My notes\n\n-","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null},"/zotero/yangComparisonsNitrogenPhosphorus2020":{"title":"# Comparisons of nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance for tomato-, basil-, and lettuce-based aquaponic and hydroponic systems","content":"\n## Metadata\n\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Teng Yang]], [[Hye-Ji Kim]]\n* URL: [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652620326664](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652620326664)\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122619](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122619)\n* Cite key: yangComparisonsNitrogenPhosphorus2020\n* Topics: [[Aquaponics]]\n* Tags: #⭕, #review, #aquaponics, #zotero, #literature-notes, #reference \n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Yang and Kim - 2020 - Comparisons of nitrogen and phosphorus mass balanc.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IDWP3YUL)\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAquaponics is known to be one of the most efﬁcient agriculture production systems by far; however, limited quantitative data are available on the level of efﬁciency, particularly in comparison to its counterpart, hydroponics. This study compared aquaponics with hydroponics to assess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) distributions, N- and P-use efﬁciency (NUE and PUE), and potential environmental impacts. Cherry tomato, basil, and lettuce were cultured in recirculating tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)based aquaponic or stand-alone hydroponic systems over a 3-month period. N and P mass balances were developed by using N and P concentrations in ﬁsh feed, solid waste, wastewater, ﬁsh biomass, and plant biomass for aquaponic systems, and chemical fertilizer, wastewater, and plant biomass for hydroponic systems, which were to estimate N and P loss from each system via denitriﬁcation and P precipitations, respectively. In aquaponics, 59e70% of total N input was estimated to be lost via denitriﬁcation (45 e50%), wastewater (14e20%), and solid waste (0.7e2%) and 30e41% was assimilated into biomass (21 e24% ﬁsh; 9e17% plants). In hydroponics, 76e87% was estimated to be lost via denitriﬁcation (69e78%) and wastewater (7e15%), and only 14e24% was assimilated into biomass. Similarly, 38e54% of total P input in aquaponics was lost via wastewater (22e28%), precipitations (8e25%), and solid waste (2e7%) and 46e62% was assimilated into biomass (35e45% ﬁsh; 11e25% plants). In hydroponics, 79e89% of total P input was lost via wastewater (52e74%) and precipitations (15e27%), and only 11e21% was assimilated into plant biomass. Plant species had a signiﬁcant impact on N and P distribution, and tomato was most effective in removing N from wastewater and reducing denitriﬁcation via higher biomass production compared to basil and lettuce. NUE was lower for aquaponics than for hydroponics when only edible plant parts were taken into consideration, but 71e114% higher when both ﬁsh and plant biomass were considered. Meanwhile, PUE was higher for aquaponics than for hydroponics even only when edible parts were considered and 336e369% higher when the biomass of both crops was considered. Our N and P mass balance analyses demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that aquaponics is more efﬁcient than hydroponics. Greater N and P losses in hydroponics were mainly due to higher N and P inputs, causing 2 times higher N loss via gas emission and up to 3 times higher P loss via inorganic P in wastewater compared to aquaponics. Therefore, reducing nutrient inputs is critical in improving NUE and PUE for both aquaponics and hydroponics, which should be combined with proper crop choice, operation conditions, and management practices to further improve the efﬁciency of the systems.\n\n\n\n## My notes\n\n-\n\n## Zotero links\n\n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_ZPEEHUJ2)","lastmodified":"2022-12-13T20:58:38.607133688Z","tags":null}}
