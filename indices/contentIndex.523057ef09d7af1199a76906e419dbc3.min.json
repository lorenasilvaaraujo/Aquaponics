{"/":{"title":"Aquaponics","content":"\n|![Aquaponics.dev logo](aquaponics.png)\u003cimg width=300/\u003e|Hi! My name is **Lorena**. Welcome to my digital garden. I am a PhD candidate at [Wageningen](https://www.wur.nl/en/about-wur.htm) working on making a tool to calculate the Return of Investment of Aquaponics endeavors. To do this, a lot of research material has to be read and digested. From fish, to micro-organisms, to plants, passing through finance and modelling.| \n|--------------|:-----:|\n\n\n\n\u003e [!info] What is the purpose for this website? üêüüí¶üçÉüå±\n\u003e\n\u003eThis page is intended to share my notes on aquaponics and its adjacent subjects (which are a lot!). Do not expect a perfect order but a review of my takes on each article I digest, the classifications I deem important for my reasearch and my personal take on the article itself.     !\n\nEven before I started my PhD I have been researching a lot about aquaponics and adjacent topics, I have ingested over a thousand articles, papers, books and videos. It is always hard to find what you want to find, either because it is bad quality, or it is not open access or even because there is just too much mess. When my reading started getting too messy I figured I needed a system to organize it and came across the concept of digital garden, personal knowledge management (PKM), zettelkasten, Zotero and Obsidian. With this in mind, I started cataloguing my notes and wondered how many other people have done the same, searched for specific literature related to specific topics. I figured I should put it out there so other people can start from a step above what I started. \n## More Info\n \nIf you¬¥d like to see more about me you can go visit my personal website [LorenaSA.com](https://lorenasa.com).

Integrated agri-aquaculture systems (IAAS) offer a number of advantages for sustainable agriculture, including water reutilization, discharge mitigation, and increased proÔ¨Åtability by leveraging the symbiotic relationship between organic waste, bacterial mineralization, and plant Ô¨Åltration. The aim of this study was to assess the production of two food items of global socio-economic importance cultivated at different salinities: PaciÔ¨Åc white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grafted to salinity tolerant wild tomatoes. PaciÔ¨Åc white shrimp were cultured at a density of 125 organisms/m3 and tomatoes at a density of 3 plants/m. The shrimp growth test consisted of three salinity levels: 2, 4, and 6 g/L. The corresponding tomato salinity treatments were conducted using shrimp water efÔ¨Çuents; Steiner‚Äôs universal nutrient solution (SNS) was used for the control treatment. The experimental period lasted 175 days. The highest tomato production (77.46 t/ha) was attained with SNS, with no signiÔ¨Åcant difference from the salinity of 2 g/L. Shrimp Ô¨Ånal mean weight, survival, and production were higher at the 6 g/L salinity; and all the other zootechnical parameters decreased with lower salinity. When compared with the hydroponic system using a cost-beneÔ¨Åt analysis (CBA), the production costs associated with the IAAS were lower primarily because of the reduced (or null) costs of fertilizer, and irrigation water. When grafted plants were used, the salinity tolerance of the commercial hybrid increased and shrimp could be cultured at appropriate salinity to facilitate osmoregulation. Chemical fertilization requirements were reduced and acceptable yields were obtained for the tomato crop by grafting to salinity-tolerant rootstocks.\n## Files and Links\n- **Url**: https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652620341093\n- **Uri**: http://zotero.org/users/5448669/items/AJLUXAWU\n- **File**: [Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al. - 2021 - Pacific white shrimp and tomato production using w.pdf](file:///D:%5CZotero%5Cstorage%5CH46QZ6JY%5CArmenta-Boj%C3%B3rquez%20et%20al.%20-%202021%20-%20Pacific%20white%20shrimp%20and%20tomato%20production%20using%20w.pdf); [armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021.md](file:///D:%5CGitHub%5Caquaponics%5Ccontent%5Czotero%5Carmenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021.md)\n- **Local Library**: [Zotero](zotero://select/library/items/AJLUXAWU)\n\n## Tags and Collections\n- **Keywords**: aquaponics; review; ‚úîÔ∏è\n\naquaponics; review; ‚úîÔ∏è: tags found in the metadata of the entry\naquaponics; review; ‚úîÔ∏è, aquaponics; review; ‚úîÔ∏è: both tags found in the metadata of the entry and tags extracted from the PDF\n0.Classify; Aquaponics: collections/folders where the entry is located\n0.Classify; Aquaponics: collections/folders where the entry is located, plus the parent folders to these\n\nYellow:\n- *‚ÄúPacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grafted to salinity tolerant wild tomatoes‚Äù* [(Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al., 2021, p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=1\u0026annotation=FL52M8HC) \n- *‚ÄúThe experimental period lasted 175 days.‚Äù* [(Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al., 2021, p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=1\u0026annotation=83P5CYUF) \n- *‚ÄúTomato was cultivated during 20 weeks in a net house (80% mesh cover)‚Äù* [(Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al., 2021, p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=2\u0026annotation=LLKAPEPG) \n- *‚ÄúThe control was one hydroponic non-grafted treatment‚Äù* [(Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al., 2021, p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=2\u0026annotation=KBQX5UKN) \n- *‚Äúhe total experiment lasted 25 weeks, including plant production and grafting (Week 0e5), biofilters nitrification (Weeks 5e9), and ending with shrimp growth (Weeks 9e25) and tomato production (Weeks 6e25)‚Äù* [(Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al., 2021, p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=2\u0026annotation=2RANY73V) \n- *‚ÄúThe four-levels factors were ecotype (three wild tomatoes plus the hybrid [Canek F1]) and the salinity factor (2, 4, 6, and 9 g/L),‚Äù* [(Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al., 2021, p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=3\u0026annotation=9GESAJIR) \n- *‚ÄúSulfuric acid (H2SO4 at 1 meq/L) was added to adjust the pH to 6 for each treatment.‚Äù* [(Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al., 2021, p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H46QZ6JY?page=3\u0026annotation=F68W8XG5) \n- *‚ÄúThe nitrogen cycle was considered established following Somerville et al.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.579514344Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

Over the past couple of decades, food production at a commercial scale in non-traditional food production environments have been emerging. Among other agricultural systems, the opportunities aquaponics systems present are becoming more apparent. Nonetheless, aquaponics' ability to bring together hydroponics and aquaculture to produce nutritious food has prompted more attention in terms of its economic viability and sustainability.

Compared results with other studies.\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nAquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponic systems where, in general terms, the waste produced by aquatic organisms becomes nutrients through bacterial action for plant growth. Water consumption as well as the environmental impact in this type of system are lower compared to more traditional hydroponic and aquaculture counterparts, due to its dual productive nature and closed condition of the system allowing the reuse of water and fish waste. The present study evaluated the yield, nitrate concentration, microbiological and functional quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in two production systems: aquaponics and hydroponics. At the same time, fresh mass gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were assessed. Lettuces were grown in an aquaponic system using waste water from the fish system, as well as in a hydroponic system with nutrient solution (Hoagland II-modified) both for 21 days. At the end of this period, baby lettuce (8 and 12 cm of length) was harvested. The yield of lettuce grown in aquaponic system was 6.73% higher than that of grown in hydroponic system. Also aquaponically grown lettuce had lower nitrate concentration (1079 mg kg-1 FW) than hydroponically grown lettuce (1229 mg kg-1 FW). Lettuces grown in both systems showed no significant differences in the microbial and functional qualities. Rainbow trout in the aquaponic system increased 13.6 g over 27.1¬±0.8 g initial fresh weight, obtaining a FCR of 0.74 after the experiment. These results indicate that the aquaponic system used in the present study is a sustainable alternative for the production of high quality lettuce considering its high yield, lower concentration of nitrates and similar microbiological and functional qualities compared to hydroponic systems, while allowing simultaneous fish farming with a good feed conversion ratio (74 g of food was needed to produce 100 g of rainbow trout).\n\n\u003e [!info] Experiment data\n\u003e- 33¬∞40‚Äô South latitude and 70¬∞40‚Äô West longitude\n\u003e- 6 experimental units with floating root system conditions\n\u003e- [[lettuce]] were harvested at 12 h in both systems when the leaves reached 8 to 12 cm of length (after 21 days from transplant)\n\u003e- Analysis of variance [[ANOVA]]\n\u003e- [[Yield]]  (6.73% higher in aquaponics) 2750  g fw/ m2 Aquaponics to 2575 g fw/m2 Hydroponics\n\u003e- [[Nitrate (NO3)]] aquaponic lettuce had\tlower nitrate concentration (1087.2¬±458.1 mg kg-1 fw)\tthan\thydroponic lettuce (1229 mg kg-1 FW).\n\u003e- [[Mesophilic Aerobic Bacteria (MAB)]]  \n\u003e- [[Feed Conversion Rate (FCR)]] 74g of food was needed to produce 100 g of [[Rainbow Trout]]\n\n[High concentrations of Nitrate can be dangerous to consumers](High%20concentrations%20of%20Nitrate%20can%20be%20dangerous%20to%20consumers.md)\n\n[Nitrate Concentration can be toxic to fish](Nitrate%20Concentration%20can%20be%20toxic%20to%20fish.md)\n\n[[Bacteria can decrease vegetable quality]]\n\n\n## Yield\n #todo Pantanella et al.

(2009) for the cultivars ‚ÄòGrand Rapids‚Äô, ‚ÄòBreeze‚Äô, ‚ÄòDivine‚Äô and ‚ÄòPrima‚Äô. The higher nitrates concentration found in hydroponic lettuce in the present study could be explained due to the greater availability of nitrate in the nutrient solution at the beginning of the experiment (150 mg L-1). While for the lettuce in the aquaponic system the average concentration of nitrate was 14.9 mg L-1.‚Äù ([Alcarraz et al., 2018, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/2J8AIQBB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=4\u0026annotation=J4EDBCXQ))\n\n\n## Mesophilic Aerobic Bacteria counts (MAB)\n#todo Sirsat and Neal (2013) with 3.2 log CFU g-1 for ‚ÄòRomaine‚Äô lettuce cultivated in aquaponics under a greenhouse. \n#todo Scuderi et al.

Integrated agri-aquaculture systems (IAAS) offer a number of advantages for sustainable agriculture, including water reutilization, discharge mitigation, and increased proÔ¨Åtability by leveraging the symbiotic relationship between organic waste, bacterial mineralization, and plant Ô¨Åltration. The aim of this study was to assess the production of two food items of global socio-economic importance cultivated at different salinities: PaciÔ¨Åc white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grafted to salinity tolerant wild tomatoes. PaciÔ¨Åc white shrimp were cultured at a density of 125 organisms/m3 and tomatoes at a density of 3 plants/m. The shrimp growth test consisted of three salinity levels: 2, 4, and 6 g/L. The corresponding tomato salinity treatments were conducted using shrimp water efÔ¨Çuents; Steiner‚Äôs universal nutrient solution (SNS) was used for the control treatment. The experimental period lasted 175 days. The highest tomato production (77.46 t/ha) was attained with SNS, with no signiÔ¨Åcant difference from the salinity of 2 g/L. Shrimp Ô¨Ånal mean weight, survival, and production were higher at the 6 g/L salinity; and all the other zootechnical parameters decreased with lower salinity. When compared with the hydroponic system using a cost-beneÔ¨Åt analysis (CBA), the production costs associated with the IAAS were lower primarily because of the reduced (or null) costs of fertilizer, and irrigation water. When grafted plants were used, the salinity tolerance of the commercial hybrid increased and shrimp could be cultured at appropriate salinity to facilitate osmoregulation. Chemical fertilization requirements were reduced and acceptable yields were obtained for the tomato crop by grafting to salinity-tolerant rootstocks.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/armenta-bojorquezPacificWhiteShrimp2021_notes":{"title":"","content":"# Annotations\n\n([Armenta-Boj√≥rquez et al., 2021, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/AJLUXAWU)) \u003cbr\u003e  \n[[aquaponics]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n[[Meta/Region/Mexico]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n[[Fish/Species/Pacific White Shrimp]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n[[Plant/Species/Tomato]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n[[Experiment]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n[[Yield]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n[[Salinity]]\u003cbr\u003e  \n[[graft]] \u003cbr\u003e  \n\\\u003eGrafting tomatoes with wild salinity resistant tomatoes can be done in an intermediate salinity level (suboptimal for both tomatoes and shrimp).

However, there is no consensus on comparability between crop yields obtained from aquaponics (AP) and conventional hydroponics (cHP). Meta-analysis was used to synthesize the literature on studies that compared crop yields of AP and cHP. Factors responsible for diÔ¨Äerences were also examined through subgroup analysis. A literature search was conducted in Ô¨Åve databases with no time restriction in order to capture any publication on AP and cHP crop yield comparisons. The search was, however, limited to journal and conference articles published in English. Study characteristics and outcome measures of food crops were extracted. A natural log response ratio eÔ¨Äect size measure was used to transform study outcomes. An unweighted meta-analysis was conducted through bootstrapping to calculate overall eÔ¨Äect size and its conÔ¨Ådence interval. Between-study heterogeneity (I2) was estimated using a random eÔ¨Äects model. Subgroup and meta-regression were used to assess moderators, in an attempt to explain heterogeneity in the eÔ¨Äect size. The results showed that although crop yield in AP was lower than conventional cHP, the diÔ¨Äerence was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. However, drawing conclusions on the overall eÔ¨Äect size must be done with caution due to the use of unweighted meta-analysis. There were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant eÔ¨Äects of aquatic organism, hydroponic system type, and nutrient supplementation used in the studies on crop yield comparisons. Nutrient supplementation, particularly, led to on average higher crop yield in AP relative to cHP. These Ô¨Åndings are a vital information source for choosing factors to include in an AP study. These Ô¨Åndings also synthesize the current trends in AP crop yields in comparison with cHP.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020":{"title":"","content":"\n# Effects of stocking density on the growth and flesh quality of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reared in a low-tech aquaponic system\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: biroloEffectsStockingDensity2020\n* Tags: #review, #‚úîÔ∏è, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Marco Birolo]], [[Francesco Bordignon]], [[Angela Trocino]], [[Luca Fasolato]], [[Ant√≥n Pascual]], [[Sergio Godoy]], [[Carlo Nicoletto]], [[Carmelo Maucieri]], [[Gerolamo Xiccato]]\n* Date: [[12/2020]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735653](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735653)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_FZLVNZLG)\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Birolo et al. - 2020 - Effects of stocking density on the growth and fles.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9N8RPIG)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nIn the present study, we evaluated the eÔ¨Äects of two stocking densities (low - ALD, 3.81 kg m‚àí3 vs. high - AHD, 7.26 kg m‚àí3) on the growth, health, and Ô¨Çesh quality of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the yield and microbiological quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) produced in a low-tech aquaponic system compared to hydroponic cultivation (HYP).

Aquaponic systems are known to be deÔ¨Åcient in several plant-essential elements, which can be aÔ¨Äected by solution pH to either increase or decrease available nutrients. To determine the eÔ¨Äect of pH in a decoupled aquaponic system, a study was conducted using aquaculture eÔ¨Ñuent from tilapia culture tanks at four pH treatments: 5.0, 5.8, 6.5, and 7.0, used to irrigate a cucumber crop. Growth and yield parameters, nutrient content of the irrigation water, and nutrients incorporated into the plant tissue were collected over two growing seasons. pH did not have a practical eÔ¨Äect on growth rate, internode length or yield over the two growing seasons. Availability and uptake of several nutrients were aÔ¨Äected by pH, but there was no overarching eÔ¨Äect that would necessitate its use in commercial systems. Nutrient concentrations in the aquaculture eÔ¨Ñuent would be considered low compared to hydroponic solutions; however, elemental analysis of leaf tissues was within the recommended ranges. Research into other nutrient sources provided by the system (i.e., solid particles carried with the irrigation water) would provide further information into the nutrient dynamics of this system.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014":{"title":"","content":"\n# Scaling aquaponic systems: Balancing plant uptake with fish output\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: buzbyScalingAquaponicSystems2014\n* Tags: #review, #‚úîÔ∏è, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Karen M.

We describe a method where the plant component was isolated from the fish rearing operation so that nutrient removal could be evaluated independently. Two crops, lettuce (Latuca sativa) and nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus), were evaluated. Nasturtium had higher removal rates and removed both total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrate resulting in 80% DIN removal while lettuce removed only 48%. Lettuce removed only TAN and was ineffective at nitrate removal. Older plants were more effective at DIN removal while younger plants were more effective at PO4removal. When normalized for biomass, younger plants had much higher removal rates. These results demonstrated that both crop and cropping method have considerable impacts on nutrient removal. This method will allow operators to adjust their system quickly and easily to meet remediation goals.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016":{"title":"","content":"\n# Implementation of an experimental nutrient film technique-type aquaponic system\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: castillo-castellanosImplementationExperimentalNutrient2016\n* Tags: #review, #‚úîÔ∏è, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[D.

The essential elements of an aquaponic system consist of the following Ô¨Åve: a tank to maintain aquatic organisms; a clariÔ¨Åer or sedimentation; a bioÔ¨Ålter; a hydroponic component; and a sump pump. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of a nutrient Ô¨Ålm technique-type aquaponic system, which does not include the sump pump. Aquaponic systems were tested during one production cycle of the Carolina cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and Parris Island lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The aquatic organism employed was tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Nine systems were utilized with the aquaponic technique, and the remaining three were utilized with only the hydroponic technique as controls in plant production. The proposed aquaponic system worked efÔ¨Åciently during the entire crop cycle without any problems or deÔ¨Åciencies from lack sump. No changes were made in the Ô¨Çow of water in the aquaponic system during the growing season. Tilapia survival was 97.2 ¬± 2.4 %. SpeciÔ¨Åc growth and food conversion ratios were 4.95 and 0.99, respectively. In plant survival, there were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences (p [ 0.05) between both production techniques. In lettuce, foliar wet weight, foliar dry weight, and yield were higher (p \\ 0.05) in hydroponics. In cucumber, fruit number and yield were higher (p \\ 0.05) in the hydroponic system.

However, the solid waste excreted by Ô¨Åsh contains considerable amounts iron, which are lost in the system by precipitation of insoluble iron oxides. Thus, the present study proposed the use of fulvic acid (FA), a humic substance with metal complexing capacity, to prevent iron precipitation and enhance its bioavailability in the aquaculture wastewater. An aquaponic solution was added with levels of fulvic acid (0, 69, 138, 345, and 690 mg L‚àí1), and analyzed for dissolved iron after incubation and centrifugation. Visual MINTEQ was used to characterize and quantify the eÔ¨Äect of fulvic acid levels on iron precipitation, species of possible solid forms, and concentration of dissolved bioavailable iron forms. Dissolved iron concentration increased with the inclusion of fulvic acid in the nutrient solution, and the highest iron concentration (22.4 ŒºM) was obtained by treating the solution with 690 mg L‚àí1 of fulvic acid. Visual MINTEQ simulations demonstrated that, in the absence of fulvic acid, iron precipitated in the form of Œ±Fe2O3, and the concentration of available iron increased with the inclusion of FA due to its complexing properties. Solution pH had no eÔ¨Äect on iron availability with the absence of fulvic acid; in its presence, the eÔ¨Äect of pH was only signiÔ¨Åcant at values below 4.5. This study shows that fulvic acid seems to play an important role in transporting low-soluble iron from Ô¨Åsh tanks to plant roots in aquaponic systems.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/chenComparativeLifeCycle2020":{"title":"","content":"\n# Comparative life cycle assessment of aquaponics and hydroponics in the Midwestern United States\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: chenComparativeLifeCycle2020\n* Tags: #review, #‚úîÔ∏è, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Peng Chen]], [[Gaotian Zhu]], [[Hye-Ji Kim]], [[Paul B.

However, both aquaponic and hydroponic systems require high energy input, leading to potential environmental burdens. This cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA), for the Ô¨Årst time, compared the environmental performance, on an economic basis, of aquaponics and hydroponics with identical system design in Indiana, US. For a one-month cultivation period, tilapia and six vegetables produced in the aquaponic system had almost twice the total value of the vegetables from the hydroponic system. Aquaponics produced 45% lower endpoint environmental impact than hydroponics. Electricity use for greenhouse heating and lighting, and water pumping and heating contributed to the majority of the environmental impacts of both systems, which was followed by the production of Ô¨Åsh feed and fertilizers. However, changing the energy source from coal to wind power could make the hydroponic system more environment-friendly than the aquaponic system. This LCA study can provide CEA farmers with the groundwork to reduce the environmental cost of their production.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/delaideEffectWastewaterPikeperch2019":{"title":"","content":"\n# Effect of wastewater from a pikeperch (Sander lucioperca L.) recirculated aquaculture system on hydroponic tomato production and quality\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: delaideEffectWastewaterPikeperch2019\n* Tags: #review, #‚úîÔ∏è, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Boris Delaide]], [[Stefan Teerlinck]], [[An Decombel]], [[Peter Bleyaert]]\n* Date: [[12/2019]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105814](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105814)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_ZMPRFZRY)\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Delaide et al. - 2019 - Effect of wastewater from a pikeperch (Sander luci.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XA5BN7RE)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nDecoupled aquaponic systems (DAPS) use the wastewater of recirculated aquaculture systems (RAS) as water source for plant production in recirculated hydroponic systems.

Unlike in single recirculating aquaponic systems, optimal growth conditions can be established in each production part of a DAPS (i.e. Ô¨Åsh and plant parts) avoiding compromises. DAPS design seems more adapted for commercial farming operations but feasibility studies on large-scale systems are lacking. Therefore, the production of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L., cv.

The comparison between aquaponics and hydroponics has attracted considerable attention recently, particularly regarding plant yield. However, previous research has not focused on the potential of using aquaponic solution complemented with mineral elements to commercial hydroponic levels in order to increase yield. For this purpose, lettuce plants were put into AeroFlo installations and exposed to hydroponic (HP), aquaponic (AP), or complemented aquaponic (CAP) solutions. The principal Ô¨Ånding of this research was that AP and HP treatments exhibited similar (p \u003e 0.05) plant growth, whereas the shoot weight of the CAP treatment showed a signiÔ¨Åcant (p \u003c 0.05) growth rate increase of 39% on average compared to the HP and AP treatments. Additionally, the root weight was similar (p \u003e 0.05) in AP and CAP treatments, and both were signiÔ¨Åcantly higher (p \u003c 0.05) than that observed in the HP treatment. The results highlight the beneÔ¨Åcial effect of recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) water on plant growth. The Ô¨Åndings represent a further step toward developing decoupled aquaponic systems (i.e., two- or multi-loops) that have the potential to establish a more productive alternative to hydroponic systems. Microorganisms and dissolved organic matter are suspected to play an important role in RAS water for promoting plant roots and shoots growth.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/doncatoMicronutrientSupplementationNeeds2021":{"title":"","content":"\n# Micronutrient supplementation needs for halophytes in saline aquaponics with BFT system water\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: doncatoMicronutrientSupplementationNeeds2021\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Kennia Brum Doncato]], [[C√©sar Serra Bonif√°cio Costa]]\n* Date: [[01/2021]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735815](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735815)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_Z3NUZRHZ)\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Doncato and Costa - 2021 - Micronutrient supplementation needs for halophytes.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R99YCDGP)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nSaline aquaponics is a fast-growing research Ô¨Åeld, although little attention has been paid to micronutrients in water from aquaculture and their nutritional potential to sustain commercial vegetable production. This study evaluated the eÔ¨Äects of micronutrient supplementation, direct in the water and by foliar spraying, against a no nutrient addition control, on growth and biomass production of the Brazilian halophytes Salicornia neei Lag., Apium graveolens L. and Paspalum vaginatum Sw., using saline aquaponics with one-year-old BFT system water from breeding stock tanks of the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Plants were established in hydroponic units and clariÔ¨Åed saline water from a BFT system was recirculated and replaced weekly over 30 days. Micronutrient addition in the water signiÔ¨Åcantly increased the concentrations of iron, manganese and molybdenum, but water quality parameters and macronutrients were not modiÔ¨Åed. Micronutrient addition in the water increased P. vaginatum growth (shoot height and leaf number) and biomass production 20‚Äì30% compared to non-supplemented plants, showing the high micronutritional requirement of this species, most likely for iron. Salicornia neei plants showed no beneÔ¨Åts when grown with the extra supply of micronutrients in the water, but a 73% reduction of shoot biomass occurred using foliar fertilization compared to the control treatment. Due to the poor development of A. graveolens plants, the response of this species to micronutrient additions could not be evaluated. Overall, clariÔ¨Åed BFT system water can supply micronutritional requirements for halophytes, but supplementation may be necessary for species that have high demands and/or are more sensitive to the neutral-alkaline condition of marine aquaculture (e.g., impairment of Fe availability), such as P. vaginatum. Foliar spraying was not eÔ¨Äective at improving halophyte growth, and caution should be taken when reusing water supplemented with micronutrients after it leaves an aquaponics system, due to the lack of knowledge about the toxicity of these added elements to animals.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/goddekComparisonLactucaSativa2018":{"title":"","content":"\n# Comparison of Lactuca sativa growth performance in conventional and RAS-based hydroponic systems\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: goddekComparisonLactucaSativa2018\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Simon Goddek]], [[Tycho Vermeulen]]\n* Date: [[12/2018]]\n* Date Added: [[2019-06-30]]\n* DOI: [10.1007/s10499-018-0293-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10499-018-0293-8)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_UD87IJPE)\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Goddek and Vermeulen - 2018 - Comparison of Lactuca sativa growth performance in.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DAAVXFB)\n\t- [Goddek and Vermeulen - 2018 - Comparison of Lactuca sativa growth performance in.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSK44QDF)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nA recent study related to aquaponics has shown that hydroponic lettuce grown in aquaculturederived supplemented water grew significantly better than lettuce grown in a conventional hydroponic system.

This gives the advantage of improved crop and fish cultivation in combination, using the minimum resource input. Up to today, the focus of aquaponics systems is mainly on fish culture and treatment of RAS effluent for optimal use in HP, and systems are designed and sized with rule of thumbs of plant growth, evapotranspiration and nutrient needs, while taking the slow responses of RAS dynamics as basis. However, in order to create the optimal fit between RAS and HP, the different systems and differences in time responses of the underlying process need to be considered. Growth of fish and plants happen in hours or days and are slow processes while photosynthesis and transpiration in crops happen in seconds or minutes and are fast processes. As in a closed loop system the main water use is due to plant transpiration, the necessary sizes of system and sub-system depend on plant transpiration. We therefore aimed at creating an aquaponics-sizing simulator based on deterministic mathematical models and thus transferrable to various circumstances with simple parameterisation. We have combined a full-scale greenhouse simulator with a possible simulation time of min 1 min including HP, greenhouse construction and physics as well as a very detailed plant energy and growth model with a model for a multi-loop aquaponics system including distillation technologies and sumps. To illustrate the quality and wide applicability of our theoretical implementation of a multi-loop aquaponics system in greenhouse conditions we made scenario simulation studies at three different climate zones as sub-arctic cold, moderate and arid subtropical regions (i.e. Faroe Islands [66¬∞N], The Netherlands [52¬∞N], and Namibia [22.6¬∞S]) using the same RAS size while simulating on the fitting HP area. For sizing, we used the element P as the most valuable macronutrient for plants. We simulated in a 1-min time steps for a 3-year duration using hourly input climate data for a complete year. Results clearly indicate the importance of transpiration dynamics on system and sub-system sizing, where e.g. the optimal HP size necessary was 11,250 m2, 10,250 m2 and 5250 m2 (tomato), or 15,750 m2, 14,000 m2 and 9250 m2 (lettuce), for Faroe Islands, The Netherlands, and Namibia, respectively.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/goddekImprovingNutrientWater2020":{"title":"","content":"\n# Improving nutrient and water use efficiencies in multi-loop aquaponics systems\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: goddekImprovingNutrientWater2020\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Simon Goddek]], [[Karel J.

Traditional aquaponics, where fish and plants are cultivated in one recirculating system, addresses these ecological challenges, but still struggles with its economical feasibility. Decoupled multi-loop aquaponics systems, in which the aquaculture and hydroponics subsystems are running autonomously, proved that they can keep up with the productivity of state-of-the-art hydroponics systems or even outscore them. Yet, a problem of such decoupled aquaponics systems was that plants require a high nutrient concentration, whereas fish prefer rather a clean water. In practice, the opposite is happening as the nutrients are added to the aquaculture units through the feed. This paper optimizes a recent approach showing that desalination technologies, such as reverse osmosis, can play an important role in reversing the concentrations within such systems without killing beneficial plant growth‚Äìpromoting rhizobacteria thermally. The proposed integrated systems approach has the potential to make both periodical nutrient and water discharges and excessive fertilizer supplementation obsolete that would otherwise be necessary to maintain good water quality for the fish and an optimal nutrient solution for the plants.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/goddekNavigatingDecoupledAquaponic2016":{"title":"","content":"\n# Navigating towards Decoupled Aquaponic Systems: A System Dynamics Design Approach\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: goddekNavigatingDecoupledAquaponic2016\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Simon Goddek]], [[Carlos Espinal]], [[Boris Delaide]], [[Mohamed Jijakli]], [[Zala Schmautz]], [[Sven Wuertz]], [[Karel Keesman]]\n* Date: [[2016-07-21]]\n* Date Added: [[2019-01-16]]\n* DOI: [10.3390/w8070303](https://doi.org/10.3390/w8070303)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_SY2X3ICZ)\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Goddek et al. - 2016 - Navigating towards Decoupled Aquaponic Systems A .pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T8H454RD)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nThe classical working principle of aquaponics is to provide nutrient-rich aquacultural water to a hydroponic plant culture unit, which in turn depurates the water that is returned to the aquaculture tanks. A known drawback is that a compromise away from optimal growing conditions for plants and Ô¨Åsh must be achieved to produce both crops and Ô¨Åsh in the same environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to develop a theoretical concept of a decoupled aquaponic system (DAPS), and predict water, nutrient (N and P), Ô¨Åsh, sludge, and plant levels. This has been approached by developing a dynamic aquaponic system model, using inputs from data found in literature covering the Ô¨Åelds of aquaculture, hydroponics, and sludge treatment. The outputs from the model showed the dependency of aquacultural water quality on the hydroponic evapotranspiration rate. This result can be explained by the fact that DAPS is based on one-way Ô¨Çows. These one-way Ô¨Çows results in accumulations of remineralized nutrients in the hydroponic component ensuring optimal conditions for the plants. The study also suggests to size the cultivation area based on P availability in the hydroponic component as P is an exhaustible resource and has been identiÔ¨Åed one of the main limiting factors for plant growth.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/goddekNecessityDesalinationTechnology2018":{"title":"","content":"\n# The necessity of desalination technology for designing and sizing multi-loop aquaponics systems\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: goddekNecessityDesalinationTechnology2018\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Simon Goddek]], [[Karel J.

We are developing a new aquaponics system to improve food productivity on such lands while effectively utilizing saline groundwater. In this study, cultivation of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L. spp. cicla cv. Seiyou Shirokuki) was carried out using fish wastewater with a high salt concentration (1150 mg L‚àí1 NaCl). The levels of microelements (e.g., Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) in the fish wastewater were very low, so we added microelements at 100% (W100), 50% (W50), 25% (W25), and 0% (W0) of the levels in the standard hydroponics solution to the fish wastewater and investigated the effects on growth of Swiss chard. At the first harvest, yields in all wastewater treatments were as high or higher than in the control. At the second harvest, yields in W100, W50, and W25 were not significantly different from the control, while in W0 the yield was significantly lower and chlorosis was evident. At the third harvest, the yield in all wastewater treatments was less than in the control, and chlorosis symptoms were observed in W25 and W0. Since leaf Mn and Zn concentrations in W25 and W0 had decreased to below the critical values for those microelements, Mn and Zn deficiency might have contributed to the observed chlorosis and yield loss. For the cultivation of Swiss chard with fish wastewater, sufficient yield (i.e., comparable to or better than the control) without chlorosis was obtained when microelements were added at 50% of the level of the control solution. In addition, since sufficient yield was obtained even in W0 at the first harvest, it is suggested that longer-term cultivation and higher yield could be achieved by applying 50% microelements after the first harvest.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/lenzCommonChicoryProduction2021":{"title":"","content":"\n# Common chicory production in aquaponics and in soil fertilized with aquaponic sludge\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: lenzCommonChicoryProduction2021\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Guilherme Luis Lenz]], [[Arc√¢ngelo Loss]], [[Cledimar Rog√©rio Lourenzi]], [[Diogo Luiz de Alcantara Lopes]], [[Lucas de Matos Siebeneichler]], [[Gustavo Brunetto]]\n* Date: [[04/2021]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.scienta.2021.109946](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.109946)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_CEPRLSPG)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nThis study assessed the common chicory performance in aquaponics and soil fertilized with aquaponics sludge. The experimental setup consisted of an aquaponic system for farming tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and culti¬≠ vating common chicory (Cichorium intybus), with two interdependent cultivation lines. The aquaponics component consisted of two treatments with six repetitions, comparing the two cultivation methods of (1) floating rafts and (2) substrate. The soil production of the plants consisted of three treatments with three rep¬≠ etitions: (1) fertilization with aquaponic sludge; (2) chemical fertilization (NPK); and (3) control (without fertilization). The sludge (80 L) was collected twice weekly from the bottom of two clarifiers, homogenized, and later applied to the soil. The results of the productive performance and the composition of the plant tissue were evaluated, comparing phyto-technical parameters (NL: number of leaves; LLL: longer leaf length; FM: fresh matter; and DM: Dry matter) of each plant between treatments in the soil and between treatments in aquaponics, and a comparison between cycles for each treatment. Higher yields (g plant‚àí 1) were obtained in the aquaponics system with the floating method when compared to the substrate method for the common chicory in the first cycle. In the second cycle, there was a higher yield of vegetables with the substrate method perhaps due to the accumulation of organic matter in the substrate. The vegetables grown in the floating method accumulated higher concentrations of N, P and K in the leaf tissues in both cycles. The production of common chicory in the soil during the first cycle showed no differences between the Sludge and NPK treatments, and both were superior to the Control for all phyto-technical parameters. Differences were shown for the LLL, FM and DM for the second cycle, with higher values shown for plants fertilized with sludge when compared to those treated with NPK or in the Control. These results suggest a cumulative effect of nutrients in the soil after successive sludge applications combined with the mineralization of nutrients, making them available in soil solution. Higher P concentrations in the leaf tissue of the common chicory in the treatment with sludge fertilization suggests higher absorption rates of this element. The aquaponic sludge can be used to fertilize vegetables in the soil and obtain yields similar to and possibly higher than those of mineral fertilization.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/magwazaPartiallyTreatedDomestic2020":{"title":"","content":"\n# Partially treated domestic wastewater as a nutrient source for tomatoes (Lycopersicum solanum) grown in a hydroponic system: effect on nutrient absorption and yield\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: magwazaPartiallyTreatedDomestic2020\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Shirly Tentile Magwaza]], [[Lembe Samukelo Magwaza]], [[Alfred Oduor Odindo]], [[Asanda Mditshwa]], [[Christopher Buckley]]\n* Date: [[12/2020]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05745](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05745)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_9JHZ6KNW)\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Magwaza et al. - 2020 - Partially treated domestic wastewater as a nutrien.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F596AVJZ)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nUsing efÔ¨Çuent from the anaerobic bafÔ¨Çed reactor (ABR) of the decentralised wastewater treatment system (DEWATS) as a sole nutrient source is not sufÔ¨Åcient for tomato plants grown in hydroponic system.

Sustainable and modern cultivation systems must involve organic fertilization and cannot ignore the role of rhizosphere microorganisms. Starting from this premise, this paper aimed to evaluate the use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and organic liquid fertilizers on soilless cultivation of basil. Genovese basil plants were cultivated in pots filled with a substrate inoculated or not with a commercial biostimulant (TNC BactorrS13) containing growth-promoting rhizobacteria (Bacillus spp.). Plants were fed only with water (control without fertilization) or with nutrient solutions (NS) that provided the same amount of nutrients with five combinations of mineral (M) and organic (O) fertilizers: 100 % M, 75 % M + 25 % O, 50 % M + 50 % O, 25 % M + 75 % O, 100 % O. The inoculum of the substrate with PGPR had no significant effect on basil plant growth but showed to be effective in decreasing the nitrate content of basil leaves. Several plant characteristics (e.g. yield, fresh and dry biomass, leaf number and area, stem diameter, etc.) showed to be negatively affected by the progressive reduction of the percentage of mineral fertilizer in the nutrient solution, in favor of the organic one, which, on the other hand, determined a significant reduction of the nitrate content of basil leaves.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/oladimejiEffectsDifferentGrowth2018":{"title":"","content":"\n# Effects of different growth media on water quality and plant yield in a catfish-pumpkin aquaponics system\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: oladimejiEffectsDifferentGrowth2018\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[A.S.

In this study, two agricultural wastes (Palm kernel shells aka PKS and Periwinkle shells aka PWS) were evaluated for their suitability as growth beds in the propagation of pumpkin Telfairia occidentalis. In addition, conventionally used gravel and its mixture with PKS and PWS (33.33% each) were also tested. The resultant effects of these treatments on water quality of the system were reported. The result obtained reveals better performance of pumpkin in the PKS and PWS medias in terms of vine length, leave area, leave number, branch number and bi-weekly plant yield. The least performance was observed in the plants propagated in the gravel substrate. Water quality and percentage nitrogenous compound reduction (NH3, NO2 and NO3) across the system and in the different grow beds suggests that mixing all substrate resulted in better water qualities for Ô¨Åsh and plant growth. Aside the superior growth observed in this study, alternative uses of these agricultural by-products in aquaponics system is highly recommended because of the possibility of converting waste to wealth.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/pantanellaAquaponicsVsHydroponics2012":{"title":"","content":"\n# Aquaponics vs. hydroponics: Production and quality of lettuce crop\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: pantanellaAquaponicsVsHydroponics2012\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[E.

Plants strip nutrients from fish waste water and convert metabolites toxic to fish. Aquaponics is an environmental-friendly production system due to its full reuse of waste and nutrients. The research, carried out at the Experimental Farm of the University of Tuscia, compared summer yields of two romaine lettuce crops (Lactuca sativa L. ‚ÄòIntegral‚Äô) grown on aquaponic and hydroponic floating systems. For the hydroponic treatment a nutritive solution of 1.7 dS m-1 and pH 5.5 supported plant growth. For the aquaponic system two treatments under different fish densities supplied nutrients at different concentrations. Every aquaponic treatment consisted of 3 independent 250-L tanks stocked with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.). Each fish tank fed a 1.5 m2 floating system under a 20 plant m-2 density. For the first crop 110 g and 24 g tilapia were stocked at system setup respectively under a low (5 kg m-3) and high (8 kg m-3) density and supplied nutrients with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.4 and 0.6 dS m-1. For the second crop 168 g and 90 g tilapia respectively stocked under a low (6 kg m-3) and high (20 kg m-3) stocking density raised EC levels to 0.5 and 1.0 dS m-1. Production of 2.8 kg m-2 from the first hydroponic crop was similar to the 2.7 kg m-2 assessed in the high density aquaponic treatment. Conversely the 2.3 kg m-2 measured in the low density treatment was smaller. For the second trial no differences were noticed between the 6.0 kg m-2 measured in the hydroponic system and the 5.7 and 5.6 kg m-2 assessed in the high and low-density aquaponic treatments, respectively. Nevertheless different nutrient concentrations in water affected plant mineral composition. Aquaponic leaves were poorer in phosphorus but richer in calcium, potassium magnesium and sodium.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/paudelNitrogenTransformationEngineered2020":{"title":"","content":"\n# Nitrogen transformation in engineered aquaponics with water celery (Oenanthe javanica) and koi carp (Cyprinus carpio): Effects of plant to fish biomass ratio\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: paudelNitrogenTransformationEngineered2020\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Shukra Raj Paudel]]\n* Date: [[04/2020]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734971](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734971)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_9RV7TA4U)\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Paudel - 2020 - Nitrogen transformation in engineered aquaponics w.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7PMKW4AW)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nNitrogen plays critically important role in dual biomasses aquaponic production. This study examined the fate of nitrogen in an aquaponics at diÔ¨Äerent plant-Ô¨Åsh (P/F) biomass ratios. A Ô¨Çoating raft hydroponic bed with water celery (Oenanthe javanica) as plant species coupled with an aquaculture tank reared with Koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) was evaluated using nitrogen mass balance techniques at P/F biomass ratio of 0.06‚Äì0.95 and feed conversion ratios (FCR) maintained at 1.73‚Äì1.85 at a constant hydraulic retention time of 24 h. The FCRs in the study were signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than FCR (1.96) in the control (aquaculture only). Nitrogen use eÔ¨Éciency (NUE) in the aquaponics increased from 29.3 ¬± 3.5 to 39.1 ¬± 4.2% as the P/F biomass ratio increased from 0.06 to 0.95, respectively. Furthermore, the increase in P/F biomass ratio to 0.95 exhibited the highest nitrogen uptake rate by plants (~56 mg/day in the hydroponic bed) which resulted in a levelling-oÔ¨Ä of the nitrate concentration at 62.5 ¬± 4.2 mg/L in the aquaculture tank. The increase in P/F biomass ratio also lowered the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 17% from the aquaponics compared to control. Overall, this study presents evidence that an aquaponics with higher P/F biomass ratio emits less N2O and has higher nutrient recovery with perpetual Ô¨Åsh production in a zero water exchange-aquaponic system.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/reyes-yanesRealtimeGrowthRate2020":{"title":"","content":"\n# Real-time growth rate and fresh weight estimation for little gem romaine lettuce in aquaponic grow beds\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: reyes-yanesRealtimeGrowthRate2020\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[A.

Computer vision can promote further contributions in smart applications in aquaponics; therefore, a methodology is pro¬≠ posed to measure in real-time the growth rate and fresh weight of crops in multi-instance setups. The proposed system uses image-processing techniques, deep learning, and regression analysis to estimate the size of the crops as they grow using image segmentation. Then, a correlation between the size of the crops and their fresh weight is modelled.

Due to this, the agriculture land is decreasing that results less food production and cannot supply necessary food for the increased population. The people already experience this problem during COVID-19 pandemic. The vertical agriculture is ideal solution that introduced to ensure food security. In this form of soilless agriculture, we use controlling environment to monitor plant growth, to record pH and EC levels daily, to test for disease detections, to supply water with required nutrients and to check CO2 concentration. In this paper, we observed that plant intakes changing at various stages such as germination, vegetative, reproduction and maturity stages. We proposed enhanced and costeffective techniques for supplying all essentials of plants as much as they required according to their stage. We introduced two methods 1. To identify the vegetative stage based on plant height 2. To identify the reproduction stage using R-CNN algorithm. This helps to inform the farmer let to know the changes in plant stages in right time.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/saseendranEnhancedGrowthResponse2021":{"title":"","content":"\n# Enhanced growth response and stress mitigation of genetically improved farmed Tilapia in a biofloc integrated aquaponic system with bell pepper\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: saseendranEnhancedGrowthResponse2021\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Sanitha Saseendran]], [[Kiran Dube]], [[M.H.

To avoid interference with background nutrients, we used reverse osmosis water in this study. The objectives were to identify critical nutrients that aÔ¨Äect the yield and quality of cherry tomato-, basil-, and lettuce by characterizing nutrient composition and concentration in aquaponic systems in comparison to hydroponic systems. Daily release rate (mg L‚àí1) of macronutrients derived from Ô¨Åsh feed (41% protein, 1.1% phosphorus, 1% Ô¨Åsh weight) was in decreasing order of SO4‚ÄìS (16) \u003e PO4‚ÄìP (2.4) \u003e NO3‚ÄìN (1.0) \u003e K (0.8) \u003e Cl (0.5) \u003e NH4‚ÄìN (0.4) \u003e Ca (0.2) \u003e NO2‚ÄìN (0.13) \u003e Na (0.11) \u003e Mg (0.02), in which daily inputs of Mg and Ca in aquaponics were found to be only 1‚Äì2% and 4‚Äì6%, respectively, of those in hydroponics. Subsequently, the average concentrations of all nutrients were signiÔ¨Åcantly lower in aquaponics than in hydroponics during a 3-month production except for Cl, NH4‚ÄìN, NO2‚ÄìN, and Na. The concentration of Mg remained below 5 mg L‚àí1 in all aquaponic systems, while the concentration of Ca rapidly decreased in tomato-based aquaponics, especially during fruiting. SPAD value (chlorophyll content) was associated with concentrations of leaf N, Mg, and/or Ca. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, lower SPAD value was correlated with lower leaf Mg and Ca for tomato and lower leaf Mg for basil but neither Mg nor Ca for lettuce. The aquaponic solution contained nearly six-times higher Na than the hydroponic solution, resulting in three-times higher Na concentration in the edible portion of the crops. Compared to a lettuce-based aquaponic system, tomato- and basil-based systems retained more desirable water quality parameters (i.e., stable pH, lower temperature), had lower electrical conductivity (EC) via greater biomass production and, therefore, more eÔ¨Écient nutrient removal, and had lower feed conversion rate and higher Ô¨Åsh biomass increment. Regardless of crop species, vegetative shoot biomass was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced in aquaponics than in hydroponics. However, the marketable yield of tomatoes was similar between aquaponics and hydroponics, while those of basil and lettuce were reduced in aquaponics by 56% and 67%, respectively, in comparison to hydroponics. Our results highlighted potential solutions to design proper nutrient management practices essential for the development of successful aquaponic production systems.

Cherry tomato, basil, and lettuce were cultured in recirculating tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)based aquaponic or stand-alone hydroponic systems over a 3-month period. N and P mass balances were developed by using N and P concentrations in Ô¨Åsh feed, solid waste, wastewater, Ô¨Åsh biomass, and plant biomass for aquaponic systems, and chemical fertilizer, wastewater, and plant biomass for hydroponic systems, which were to estimate N and P loss from each system via denitriÔ¨Åcation and P precipitations, respectively. In aquaponics, 59e70% of total N input was estimated to be lost via denitriÔ¨Åcation (45 e50%), wastewater (14e20%), and solid waste (0.7e2%) and 30e41% was assimilated into biomass (21 e24% Ô¨Åsh; 9e17% plants). In hydroponics, 76e87% was estimated to be lost via denitriÔ¨Åcation (69e78%) and wastewater (7e15%), and only 14e24% was assimilated into biomass. Similarly, 38e54% of total P input in aquaponics was lost via wastewater (22e28%), precipitations (8e25%), and solid waste (2e7%) and 46e62% was assimilated into biomass (35e45% Ô¨Åsh; 11e25% plants). In hydroponics, 79e89% of total P input was lost via wastewater (52e74%) and precipitations (15e27%), and only 11e21% was assimilated into plant biomass. Plant species had a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on N and P distribution, and tomato was most effective in removing N from wastewater and reducing denitriÔ¨Åcation via higher biomass production compared to basil and lettuce. NUE was lower for aquaponics than for hydroponics when only edible plant parts were taken into consideration, but 71e114% higher when both Ô¨Åsh and plant biomass were considered. Meanwhile, PUE was higher for aquaponics than for hydroponics even only when edible parts were considered and 336e369% higher when the biomass of both crops was considered. Our N and P mass balance analyses demonstrated for the Ô¨Årst time that aquaponics is more efÔ¨Åcient than hydroponics. Greater N and P losses in hydroponics were mainly due to higher N and P inputs, causing 2 times higher N loss via gas emission and up to 3 times higher P loss via inorganic P in wastewater compared to aquaponics. Therefore, reducing nutrient inputs is critical in improving NUE and PUE for both aquaponics and hydroponics, which should be combined with proper crop choice, operation conditions, and management practices to further improve the efÔ¨Åciency of the systems.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/yepComparingHydroponicAquaponic2020":{"title":"","content":"\n# Comparing hydroponic and aquaponic rootzones on the growth of two drug-type Cannabis sativa L. cultivars during the flowering stage\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: yepComparingHydroponicAquaponic2020\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Brandon Yep]], [[Nigel V.

(C. sativa) employs a variety of rootzone systems, yet little is understood about rootzone-effects on plant physiology, inflorescence biomass, and cannabinoid potency. To determine if rootzone systems can affect C. sativa growth, physiology, and inflorescence biomass and phytochemicals, two C. sativa cultivars, colloquially known as ‚ÄòNordle‚Äô and ‚ÄòSensi-Star‚Äô, were grown in three rootzone systems in a controlled environment. The three tested rootzone systems were: 1) an 11-litre pot containing a peat-based growing substrate, top fertigated with a synthetic fertilizer solution (‚Äúhydroponic‚Äù); 2) an 11-litre pot containing a peat-based growing substrate, top fertigated with aquaculture effluent solution (‚Äúaquaculture‚Äù); and 3) a 3-litre pot containing a custom made, predominantly peat-based growing substrate, with the lower portion of the roots submerged in a conventional aquaponics deep-water culture system (‚Äúaquaponics‚Äù). Throughout the experiment, plant growth (height, branch number, canopy volume), leaf-level physiological traits (e.g., chlorophyll) foliar mineral nutrition, and substrate physio-chemical properties were measured. At experimental completion, inflorescence yield (dry biomass) and potency (mass-based cannabinoid and terpene concentrations) were determined. Results revealed, significant rootzone-effects on most growth and physiological traits measured. Plants performed best in the in the hydroponic rootzone: e.g., producing 42‚Äì116% greater inflorescence biomass than the other rootzone systems. In contrast, however, Nordle plants in the aquaponics treatment had greater Œî9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and the terpenes √ü-pinene and limonene, relative to their congeners grown in the other rootzones investigated. Pronounced differences in substrate macro-nutrient availability and foliar nutrient content occurred among the rootzones, suggesting a potential mechanism to explain the observed growth, physiological, yield and potency responses. This work underscores the importance of the rootzone environment for the cultivation of C. sativa, specifically in indoor systems focused of medical or research production.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-28T22:08:36.635517543Z","tags":null},"/zotero/zhangRecoveryNutrientsFish2020":{"title":"","content":"\n# Recovery of nutrients from fish sludge in an aquaponic system using biological aerated filters with ceramsite plus lignocellulosic material media\n\n## Metadata:\n\ntype:¬†üì•\n* Cite key: zhangRecoveryNutrientsFish2020\n* Tags: #‚≠ï, #review, #aquaponics\n* Item Type: [[Article]]\n* Authors: [[Hong Zhang]], [[Yueshu Gao]], [[Hongtao Shi]], [[Chew Tin Lee]], [[Haslenda Hashim]], [[Zhenjia Zhang]], [[Wei-Min Wu]], [[Chunjie Li]]\n* Date: [[06/2020]]\n* Date Added: [[2021-02-05]]\n* DOI: [10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120886](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120886)\nzotero_url: * [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_J4KCKZKI)\n* PDF Attachments\n\t- [Zhang et al. - 2020 - Recovery of nutrients from fish sludge in an aquap.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QHGUG2XU)\n\n\u003e## Abstract\n\nThe recovery of nutrients from residual Ô¨Åsh sludge in aquaponics could achieve zero solid waste discharge and supplement additional nutrients to hydroponics, thus yielding environmental and economic beneÔ¨Åts. In this study, novel biological aerated Ô¨Ålters (BAFs) with ceramsite plus different lignocellulosic materials (corn straw, wheat straw, and sawdust) are designed and installed in aquaponic systems. The BAFs performed the Ô¨Åsh sludge separation and nutrient conversion in a single equipment without the necessity for backwashing. The potential for nutrient recovery from Ô¨Åsh sludge is evaluated by comparing four BAFs Ô¨Ålled with different media. The BAF with ceramsite plus sawdust achieves the highest mineralization capacity based on nitriÔ¨Åcation and dissolved total phosphorus. The average concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S macronutrients reach 12.3%, 11.8%, 4.5%, 26.4%, 22.6%, and 46.0% of those of Hoagland nutrient solution, respectively. The recovered Fe, Mn, and B micronutrients are 10.0%, 12.0%, and 18.0%, respectively, whereas Cu, Zn, and Mo are 1.5, 1.8, and 1.0 times, respectively, of those of Hoagland nutrient solution. The estimated nutrient recoveries of Ca, Mg, and S have good performance efÔ¨Åciencies, followed by K and Cu; those of N, P, Fe, Mn, and Zn have potentials for further improvement. The modiÔ¨Åed aquaponics with BAFs are proposed for the recovery of both dissolved and solid nutrients. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
